I hope you find some peace of mind in this lifetime
Tell them, tell ′em, tell them the truth
I hope you find some paradise (tell them, tell 'em the truth)Tell ′em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell them your-

I′ve been goin′ through somethin'
One thousand, eight hundred and 55 days
I′ve been goin' through somethin′
Be afraid

What is a bitch in a miniskirt?
A man in his feelings with bitter nerve
What is a woman that really hurt?
A demon, you're better off killin′ her
What is a relative, making repetitive narratives on how you did it first?
That is a predator, hit reverse
All of your presidents evil thirst

What is a neighborhood rep'table?
That is a snitch on a pedestal
What is a house with a better view?
A family broken in variables
What is a rapper with jewelry?
A way that I show my maturity
What if I call on security?
That mean I'm calling on God for purity

I went and got me a therapist
I can debate on my theories and sharing it (whoa)
Consolidate all my comparisons
Humblin′ up because time was imperative (whoa)
Started to feel like it′s only one answer to everything, I don't know where it is (whoa)
Popping a bottle of Claritin (whoa)
Is it my head or my arrogance? (Whoa)

Shaking and moving, like, what am I doing? I′m flipping my time through the Rolodex
Indulging myself and my life and my music, the world that I'm in is a cul-de-sac
The world that we in is just menacing, the demons portrayed religionous
I wake in the morning, another appointment, I hope the psychologist listenin′

The new Mercedes with black G Wagon
The "Where you from?" It was all for rap
I was 28 years young, twenty mill' in tax
Bought a couple of mansions just for practice
Five hundred in jewelry, chain was magic
Never had it in public, late reaction
50K to cousins, post a caption
Pray none of my enemies hold me captive

I grieve different

I grieve different
Huh

I met her on the third night of Chicago
North America tour, my enclave
Fee-fi-fo-fum, she was a model
Dedicated to the songs I wrote and the Bible
Eyes like green, penetratin′ the moonlight
Hair done in a bun, energy in the room like
Big Bang for theory, God, hopin' you hear me
Phone off the ringer, tell the world I'm busy

Fair enough, green eyes said her mother didn′t care enough
Sympathize when her daddy in the chain gang
Her first brother got killed, he was 21
I was nine when they put Lamont in the grave
Heartbroken when Estelle didn′t say goodbye
Chad left his body after we FaceTimed
Green eyes said you'd be okay, first tour, sex the pain away

I grieve different

I grieve different
Huh

The new Mercedes with black G Wagon
The "Where you from?" It was all for rap
I was 28 years young, twenty mill′ in tax
Bought a couple of mansions just for practice
Five hundred in jewelry, chain was magic
Never had it in public, late reaction
50K to cousins, post a caption
Pray none of my enemies hold me captive

So what? Paralyzed, the county building controlled us
I bought a Rolex watch, I only wore it once
I bought infinity pools, I never swimmed in
I watched Keem buy four cars in four months
You know the family dynamic's on repeat
The insecurities locked down on PC
I bought a .223, nobody peace treat
You won′t doo-doo me, I smell TNT

Dave got him a Porsche, so I got me a Porsche
Paid lottery for it, I ain't want it in portions
Poverty was the case
But the money wipin′ the tears away

I grieve different
Everybody grieves different
Everybody grieves different
I grieve different
Huh
Hello, new world
All the boys and girls
I got some true stories to tellYou′re back outside
But they still lied
Whoa-oh-oh-oh (yeah)

Take off the foo-foo, take off the clout chase, take off the Wi-Fi
Take off the money phone, take off the car loan, take off the flex and the white lies
Take off the weird ass jewelry, I'ma take ten steps, then I′m takin' off top five
Take off them fabricated streams and them microwave memes, it's a real world outside (take that shit off)

Take off your idols, take off the runway, I take off to Cairo (take that shit off)
Take off to Saint-Tropez, five-day stay, take a quarter mill′, hell, if I know (take that shit off)
Take off the front flag, take off perception, take off the cop with the eye patch (take that shit off)
Take off the unloyal, take off the unsure, take off decisions I lack (take it off)

Take off the fake deep, take off the fake woke, take off the, "I′m broke, I care" (take it off)
Take off the gossip, take off the new logic that if I'm rich, I′m rare (take it off)
Take off the Chanel, take off the Dolce, take off the Birkin bag (take it off)
Take all that designer bullshit off, and what do you have?

Bitch, huh-huh
Ugh, you ugly as fuck (you outta pocket)
Huh, two ATMs, you steppin' or what? (You outta pocket)
Huh, who you think they talk about? Talk about us (shoot, shoot, shoot, you out of pocket)
Who you think they copy off? Copy off us (get back in pocket)

The world in a panic, the women is stranded, the men on a run
The prophets abandoned, the law take advantage, the market is crashin′, the industry wants
Niggas and bitches to sleep in a box while they makin' a mockery followin′ us
This ain't Monopoly, watchin' for love
This ain′t monogamy, y′all gettin' fucked

Jumping on, "What the hell is that?" I gotta relax when I feel (huh, facts)
All my decendents, they come in my sleep and say I am too real (huh, facts)
I′m done with the sensitive, takin' it personal
Done with the black and the white, the wrong and the right
You hopin′ for change and clericals, I know the feelings that came with burial's cries

Bitch, huh-huh
Ugh, you ugly as fuck (you outta pocket)
Huh, two ATMs, you steppin′ or what? (You outta pocket)
Huh, who you think they talk about? Talk about us (shoot, shoot, shoot, you out of pocket)
Who you think they copy off? Copy off us (get back in pocket)

Servin' up a look, dancin' in the drought
Hello to the big stepper, never losin′ count
Ventin′ in the safe house, ventin' in the sa-

Can I vent all my truth? I got nothin′ to lose
I got problems and pools, I can swim in my faith
Camera's movin′ whenever I'm movin′
The family suin' whatever I make
Murder is stackin', the president actin′
The government taxin′ my funds in a bank
Homies attractin' the feds when I′m brackin'
Look at my reaction, my pupils on skates (hol′ up, hol' up)

Let′s think about this for a second (let's go)
Tell me what you would do for aesthetic (let's go)
Would you sell your soul on credit? (Let′s go)
Would you sell your bro for leverage? (Let′s go)

Where the hypocrites at?
What community feel they the only ones relevant? (Go)
Where the hypocrites at?
What community feel they the only ones relevant? (Go, huh-huh-huh)

You outta pocket, yeah, you outta pocket (this shit hard)
You entertain the mediocre, need to stop it (this shit hard)
You entertainin' old friends when they toxic (this shit hard)
What′s your life like? Bullshit and gossip (this shit hard)
What the fuck is cancel culture, dawg?
Say what I want about you niggas, I'm like Oprah, dawg
I treat you crackers like I′m Jigga, watch, I own it all
Oh, you worried 'bout a critic? That ain′t protocol (bitch)
Kodak Black, Oklama
Eckhart Tolle
And this here is the big stepper
I′m a killer, he's a killer, she′s a killer
We some killers, walkin' zombies, tryna scratch that itch
Germophobic, hetero and

I am not for the faint of heart
My genetic build can build multi-universes, the man of God
Playin' "Baby Shark" with my daughter
Watchin′ for sharks outside at the same time
Life as a protective father, I′d kill for her
My son Enoch is the part two
When I expire, my children'll make higher valleys
In this present moment, I saw that through

Ask Whitney about my lust addiction
Text messaging bitches got my thumbs hurt
Set precedent for a new sacrilegion
Writer′s block for two years, nothin' moved me
Asked God to speak through me, that′s what you hearin' now
The voice of yours truly
Teleport out my own body for comfort

I don′t pass judgment, past life regressions keep me in question
Where did I come from? I don't think like I used to
No, I don't blink like I used to
Awkward stares at everybody, see the flesh of man
But still, this man compared to nobody
Yesterday, I prayed to the flowers and trees
Gratification to the powers that be
Synchronization with my energy chakras, the ghost of Dr. Sebi
Paid it forward, cleaned out my toxins, bacteria heavy
Sciatica nerve pinch, I don′t know how to feel
Like the first time I fucked a white bitch

The first time I fucked a white bitch
I was sixteen at the Palisades
Fumbling my grades, I traveled with the team
The apache life, Centennial was like
When Mrs. Baker screamed at Doughboy
Mixed that with Purple Rain
They interchanged the scenes
Happy just to be out the hood
With all the wealthy kids

Credit cards and family plans
She drove her daddy′s Benz
I found out that he was a sheriff
That was a win-win
Because he had locked up Uncle Perry
She paid her daddy's sins

Next time I fucked a white bitch
Was out in Copenhagen
Good kid, m.A.A.d city tour
I flourished on them stages
Whitney asked did I have a problem
I said, "I might be racist"
Ancestors watchin′ me fuck was like retaliation

I'm a killer, he′s a killer, she's a killer
We some killers, walkin′ zombies, tryna scratch that itch
Germophobic, hetero and homophobic
Photoshopping lies and motives
Hide your eyes, then pose for the pic

What the-

Eight billion people on Earth, silent murderers
Non-profits, preachers and church, crooks and burglars (woo)
Hollywood corporate in school, teachin' philosophies
You either gon' be dead or in jail, killer psychology

Silent murderer, what′s your body count? Who your sponsorship?
Objectified so many bitches, I killed their confidence (what the)
The media′s the new religion, you killed the consciousness (what the)
Your jealousy is way too pretentious, you killed accomplishments (what the)
Niggas killed freedom of speech, everyone sensitive (what the)
If your opinion fuck 'round and leak, might as well send your will (what the)
The industry has killed the creators, I′ll be the first to say (what the)
To each exec', "I′m saving your children", we can't negotiate (what the)

I caught a couple of bodies myself, slid my community
My last Christmas toy drive in Compton handed out eulogies
Not because the rags in the park had red gradient
But because the high blood pressure flooded the caterin′
So what's the difference 'tween your life when hiding motives?
More fatalities and reality bring you closure
The noble person that goes to work and pray like they ′posed to?
Slaughter people too, your murder′s just a bit slower

I'm a killer, he′s a killer, she's a killer (what the)
We some killers, walkin′ zombies, tryna scratch that itch (what the)
Germophobic, hetero and homophobic
Photoshopping lies and motives
Hide your eyes, then pose for the pic
I pop the pain away, I slide the pain away
I pop the pain away, I slide the pain away
I picked you up when you fell and cut your kneeI told you not to cry and held you close to me

I hope I′m not too late to set my demons straight
I know I made you wait, but how much can you take?
I hope you see the God in me, I hope you can see
And if it's up, stay down for me, yeah

Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa pop
Serafina, flame in ice
Where I′d be without your love
Rest your wings and trust, I feel you

Deep (I know you feel), deep (know you feel)
Deep (I know you feel), deep (too deep)
Deep (I know you feel), deep (know you feel)
Deep (I know you feel), deep

Do you love me? (Okay) Do you trust me? (Okay)
Can I trust you? (Okay) Don't judge me (okay)
I'ma die hard, it gets ugly (okay)
Too passionate, it gets ugly (okay)
Mmm, ah-ah
I wonder where I lost my way
Mmm, ah-ah
Been waiting on your call all day

Tell me you in my corner right now
When I fall short, I′m leaning on you to cry out
We all got enough to lie about
My truth too complicated to hide now
Can I open up? Is it safe or not?
I′m afraid a little, you relate or not?
Have faith a little, I might take my time
Ain't no saving face this time

I hope I′m not too late to set my demons straight
I know I made you wait, but how much can you take?
I hope you see the God in me, I hope you can see
And if it's up, stay down for me, yeah

Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa pop
Serafina, flame in ice
Where I′d be without your love
Rest your wings and trust, I feel you

Deep (I know you feel), deep (know you feel)
Deep (I know you feel), deep (too deep)
Deep (I know you feel), deep (know you feel)
Deep (I know you feel), deep

I got some regrets (I-I-I, yeah, yeah)
But my past won't keep me from my best (I-I-I, yeah, yeah)
Subtle mistakes felt like life or death (I-I-I, yeah, yeah)
I wanna see the family stronger
I wanna see the money longer
You know that I′d die for you (I'd die for you)

I get emotional about life
The lost ones keepin' me up at night
The world be reminding me it′s danger
I′ll still risk it all for a stranger
If I told you who I am, would you use it against me?
Right or wrong, no stone, just love to send me

I hope I'm not too late to set my demons straight
I know I made you wait, but how much can you take?
I hope you see the God in me, I hope you can see
And if it′s up, stay down for me, yeah

Baby, you make me pray for London
Yeah, 'cause if I won it all without you involved
I guess it′s all for nothing

I learned in trappin′, in the business
Smart people makin' horrible decisions, you know?
Rich nigga, gettin′ my dick sucked after the showI ain't gonna lie, we were poor
A bunch of lost souls in survival mode
It wasn't no way for us unless we find our own

Runnin′ in stores, kickin′ in doors, nigga, give me my glory
Nigga play with me, he ain't gon′ live to tell the story
You know, this the type of shit we glorify
Everybody "gang-gang"
Most of the people that you grew up with are now in chain gang
In the box, gettin' pink

Niggas shittin′ where you sleep
Nigga shittin' where you eat
Who′da ever knew that I'd become a fuckin' Kodak? Yeah
Rap money good but I′m still pumpin′ aas through the hood
Droppin' off plates to the fam′ like Thanksgivin'
Got the baby snipers standin′ on that murk business, yeah, slidin' for Yak
They ready for whatever

I always knew that everything would get better
And it sure got greater later
All the game came from the elders like hand-me-downs
Me and my brothers wearin′ hand-me-downs
Now I'm givin' game back to the old heads
And the respect come first, yeah, you know?

Can′t be better than the OGs
You gotta get it somewhere
Gotta come from somethin′
Gotta come from nothin'
We ain′t seen this comin'
It′s more than a blessin'

What you doing with Kendrick? (Ooh, ooh)

Poverty (ooh, ooh)
Red Cross, food banks, W.I.C. (ooh, ooh)
Now look at this shit, we own property
Takin′ my baby to school, then I pray for her
'Cause you bitches ain′t never been cool, writin' testament
Paintin' pictures, put me in the Louvre, that′s a definiteUniversal shift, I′m in a groove and celebrity do not mean integrity, you fool
I'm a good man, shakin′ hand, firm grip rule
72 ways, lost ten, ballin' with the flu
More than two M′s for a show, but add another two
Hmm, lil' Man-Man, the big mans, the GT diamond flippin′ the kickstand (ooh)

The morality can wait, feedback on low latency
I'm glitchin′ from the face as my thoughts grow sacredly
I'm runnin′ out of space, ask Whitney she okay
Never mind a hundred K, why you lyin' on Benjamin?
He turnin′ in his grave
I'd be lyin' if I said I wouldn′t give this shit away
The aloof Buddha, I′m Christ with a shooter
Praise to Muhammad, I might nigga-news you

AP Michael Freeman, my friends cooler
Primary, so the resale value stupid
I would never live my life on the computer
IG'll get you life for a chikabooya
More power to ya, love ′em from a distance

Rollin′ sevens, I ain't ready for no coffin
I know y'all love it when the drugs talkin′, butShut the f- up when you hear love talkin′
Shut the f- up when you hear love talkin'
If God be the source then I am the plug talkin′
Yeah, baby, yeah, baby
Yeah, baby, yeah, baby

This my undisputed truth, uh-huh
My life is like forbidden fruit, my b- know better than I do
A woman's worth, I barely went to church
I′d rather fast with you than f- it up
F- with skirts 'cause I′m rational
A n- still gon' be a-, emoji heart, my family pictures
Two-steppin' away from rappers, I don′t trust their true intentions
I′m not in the music business, I been in the human business
Whole life been social distant, h- like, "When you not trippin'?"

I duck the party, who said they saw me?
Crown on Bob Marley, wrist on Yo Gotti
They gon′ judge your life for a couple likes on the double tap
Them h- is sorry, they all get bodied
I bless it that you have an open heart, I bless that you forgive
I bless it that you can learn from a loss, I bless it that you heal
I bless one day that you attract somebody with your mind exact
A patient life, flaws, bless 'em twice, and they′ll bless you back

Tippy-toeing and I'm mud-walkin′, hmm
Rollin' sevens, I ain't ready for no coffin
I know y′all love it when the drugs talkin′, but

Gossiping ′bout some sh- you don't know
Oh, you ho (yeah, yeah, yeah) fo' sure
I hate it here, baby daddy still on my phone
I hate it here, asking if I been on the pole
I hate it here, if you keep lurking on the low
If you a fan, just let me know
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)

Now if it′s love, I deserve to get some - on a balcony sometimes, sometimes
And if I feel where your heart can be, you′ll still be a part of me
I love mine, love mine (love mine, love mine)
Summer in the storm, I cannot conform
(I cannot conform, I cannot conform)
I just might love you still, just think I love me more
It ain't love if you gon′ judge me for my past
No, it ain't love if you ain′t never eat my -
It ain't love if you just only tie me down because you seen me in my bag
That′s why I'm anti-everyone before this mask

Mmm, tippy-toeing and I'm mud-walkin′, hmm
Rollin′ sevens, I ain't ready for no coffin
I know y′all love it when the drugs talkin', but
Shut the f- up when you hear love talkin′
Shut the f- up when you hear love talkin'
If God be the source, then I am the plug talkin′
Yeah, baby, yeah, baby
Yeah, baby, yeah

Yo, yo
Telekinesis, I'm purifying these D speeches
While I'm crying, I clean the feet of the sweet Jesus
Dreams, visions get blurry of the Elohim, it′s light
It′s known to tear retinas in a single gleam
Shut the f- up when you hear His love talkin'
To the mind, it′s God's cypher divine in a small portion, uh
Faded pictures, this global madness, the intervention
This world′s in The Twilight Zone, this is the fifth dimension

God, please blow the whistle, we need an intermission
My good deeds in front of your door, I'm standing by the entrance
With heavy baggage, my brother′s ashes
I seen tragic, I did dirt, smacked death and held it to that - cabbage
Love, we killin' greed, we killin' homelessness
And I don′t give a - about this land, I want ownership
Bow your head for just God′s sake
Listen what the stars say when I say it's God′s way

Tippy-toeing and I'm mud-walkin′, hmm
Rollin' sevens, I ain′t ready for no coffin
I know y'all love it when the drugs talkin', but
Shut the f- up when you hear love talkin′
Shut the f- up when you hear love talkin′
If God be the source, then I am the plug talkin'
Yeah, baby, yeah, baby
Yeah, baby, yeah, baby
We may not know which way to go on this dark road

(Mr. Duckworth)All of these hoes make it difficult

Session ten, breakthrough

One of these lives, I′ma make things right
With the wrongs I've done, that′s one of you now
With the Father, Son, 'til then, I fight
Rain on me, put the blame on me
Got guilt, got hurt, got shame on me
Got six magazines that's aimed at me
Done every magazine, what′s fame to me?

It′s a game to me, where the bedroom at? (And I'm tripping and falling)
Sleep, I ain′t never had affairs with that
What's fed when the hearts and the words don′t reach?
What's fair when the money don′t take things back?
It's rare when somebody take your dreams back

I care too much, wanna share too much (and I'm tripping and falling)
In my head too much, I shut down too
I ain′t there too much, I′m a complex soul
They layered me up, then broke me down
And morality's dust, I lack in trust

This time around, I trust myself (and I′m tripping and falling)
Please everybody else but myself
All else fails, I was myself
Outdone fear, outdone myself
This year, you better one yourself

Masks on the babies, mask on an opp (and I'm tripping and falling)
Wear masks in the neighborhood stores you shop
But a mask won′t hide who you are inside
Look around, the reality's carved in the lies
Wipe my ego, dodge my pride

Look myself in the mirror (and I′m tripping and falling)
Amityville, I ain't seen nothing scarier (on and on and on and on)
I fought like a Pitbull Terrier, blood I shed could fill up aquariums
Tell all my angels, "Carry 'em" (and I′m tripping and falling)
Every emotion been deprived, even my strong points couldn′t survive
If I didn't learn to love myself, forgive myself a hundred times, dawg

I love when you count me out (huh)
I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out (brrah, ooh, brrah, ooh, brrah)
I love when you count me out (brrah, ooh, brrah, ooh, brrah)
Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fucking it up
How you gon′ win my trust when the lies run deep? (Brrah, ooh, brrah)
How you gon' bend your love when the bad don′t sleep?
Beep, beep, crash our feelings in the middle of the street (vroom, vroom)
Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fucking it up

When you was at your lowest, tell me, where the hoes was at?
When you was at your lowest, tell me, where the bros was at?
3:30 in the morning, scroll through the call log
Ain't nobody but the mirror looking for the fall off (brrr)

I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out (brrah, ooh, brrah, ooh, brrah)
My name is in your mouth, shoo, shoo

It′s gon' take more than pride to stop
Call 911, I caught a body
Sun up now, yesterday is fading
Healing's only one mile away

Let me tell you ′bout the women I know (that′s my baby)
I know karma like to follow us strong (sheesh)
I know millionaires that feel alone (sheesh)
Anytime I couldn't find God, I still could find myself through a song
Many find they life in a phone

Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fucking it up

You said I′d feel better if I just worked hard
Without lifting my head up, that left me fed up
You made me worry, I wanted my best version
But you ignored me, then changed the story
Then changed the story

Good energy in the room, drop the location, please
Antibiotic for the womb when I'm frustrated, please
(Antibiotic for the womb when I′m frustrated)
Tryna keep my good conscious in rotation (no, no)
Thoughts in my head, they living there with no (tryna keep my good)

I made a decision, never give you my feelings
Fuck with you from, fuck with you from a distance
Some put it on the devil when they fall short
I put it on my ego, lord of all lords
Sometimes I fall for her, dawg

I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out (sheesh)
I love when you count me out (sheesh)
I love when you count me out (brrah, ooh, brrah, ooh, brrah)
My name is in your mouth
Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fucking it up (shoo, shoo)

Miss Regrets, I believe that you done me wrong (Miss Regrets)
Miss Regrets, can you please exit out my home? (Miss Regrets)
Miss Regret, I think I'm better off alone (Miss Regrets)
Miss Regret, Miss Regret, I got these deep regrets

(And I′m tripping and falling) some things I can't forget
Lord knows, I tried my best, you said it's not my best
I came up out my flesh
Some things I must confess (and I′m tripping and falling)
Spoke my truth, paid my debt, can′t you see I'm a wreck? (Ah-yah)
Let me lose, I digress, this is me and I′m blessed (ah-yah, ah-yah)

This is me and I'm blessed (ah-yah)
This is me and I′m blessed (ah-yah)
This is me and I'm blessed (ah-yah)
Anybody fighting through the stress? (Ah-yah)
Anybody fighting through the-
You walk around, like everything is in control
Favor come with favors and you can′t say no
Go out the way to make the coin availableThat's what I call love

The closest ones afraid to say they need some time
The turnaround is life or death, but you don′t mind
Go out the way to say you made the compromise
That's what I call love

But the time, it'll come to not be there when somebody needs you
You say, "No" and all you′ve done gives them amnesia
One thing I′ve learned, love can change with the seasons

And I can't please everybody
No, I can′t please everybody
Wait, you can't please everybody
No, I can′t please everybody (I can't please everybody)

They idolize and praise your name across the nation
Tap the feed and nod the head for confirmation
Promise that you keep the music in rotation
That′s what I call love (that's what I call love)

But the time, it'll come to not be there when somebody needs you
You say, "No" and all you′ve done gives them amnesia (they don′t remember)
One thing I've learned love can change with the seasons

And I can′t please everybody
No, I can't please everybody
Wait, you can′t please everybody
No, I can't please everybody

And I can′t please everybody
No, I can't please everybody
Wait, you can't please everybody
No, I can′t please everybody

Heavy is the head that chose to wear the crown
To whom is given much is required now
Heavy is the head that chose to wear the crown
To whom is given much is required now

I can′t please everybody (I can't please everybody)
I can′t please everybody (I can't please everybody)
Love gon′ get you killed (love gon' get you killed)
Uh, I can′t please everybody (I can't please everybody)
Uh, I can't even please myself (I can′t even please myself)
Uh, I thought a new car would help (I thought a new car would help)
Uh, but when that new car get old (but when that new car get old)
Uh, I′m sure to want something else, I-I-I

Head up, chest out
Silence, I'm stressed out
Shh, be quiet, I′m stressed out
Stressed out, stressed out, stressed
Pick my daughter up, she need all the love
I need all the love, I mean all of us
It's like six o'clock, you talk too much
You makin′ it awkward, love
I mean, it′s hard enough, I mean, it's-

They don′t f- with me even if they could
Pull out the stick, hit a b- with the wood
First to park Rolls Royce, 'vert in the hood
Don′t worry about us, over here we good
The AP Roman numeral, everywhere I go, I need pharmaceuticals
I ran my whole conglomerate, I was just mappin sh- out in the cubicle

Suicide coupe was a funeral, Trackhawk launch like a slingshot
Big ol' ruby diamond on my pinky finger, that b- look like a Ring Pop
Money on my mind, money on your head
Can′t ride three times while you comin' through the 'jects
Red Cross kept a- fed
In the studio with K. Dot fresh out the feds

Yeah, you n- can′t stand the rain, don′t stand a chance
Yeah, Chevrolet candy paint, I spin the bend in the Benz
I caught a bale off a Google app
I'm the type to get my shooter whacked
I had to survive off a tuna pack

Five percent tint on the whip like, "Who was that?"
Coupe take off like it′s mad
Beat the d- with a fork, I'm whippin′ up Sudafed, I'm doin′ scams in the lab
Every Thursday, girl's day, spendin' time with my daughter, make me go harder
Every Sunday′s son′s day, teach my boy to be a man, I ain't had no father
Fell in the love with the block, I ain′t have no pop, just a sawed-off shotgun, Mossberg
We stackin' that money up proper, awkward diamonds, look like marbles
Audemars water, aqua, beatin′ the block up 'til we spot ′em
I don't want your ice, boy, I want your life, but-, I still might rob 'em

Yo

Silence, I'm stressed out
Shh, be quiet, I'm stressed out
Stressed out, stressed out, stressed out
If you derive your sense of identity from being a victim
Let′s say, bad things were done to you when you were a child
And you develop a sense of self that is based on the bad things that happened to you
You ever seen your mama strung out while you studied division?
Your uncle ever stole from you, day after Christmas?
Seen both of those in the county jail visits
The first and the fifteenth, the only religion
Noodles in the microwave, shark tank tidal wave
Grandma shooting niggas, blood on the highway
Crosses on the dashboard, you just want a platform
I wanna take everything that I ask for

Catch me a body, I'll put that on anybody but my mama
She showing a pattern for certain
I think it′s white panties and minimal condoms
My uncle would tell me the shit in the movies could only be magic
This year, I did 43 shows and took it all home to buy him a casket
Jack of all trades, got money out the way, put my heart in the faith, I'm good, love

Cousin in the courts, heard he jumped out the porch
Turn a brick to a Porsche, I'm good, love
Catch us, you know I′m gon′ rack up
I need the advance and the equity to match up
The engineer dead if the drive don't back up
These words come from God, you could never outrap us

Nowadays gotta walk cautious, ayy
Nowadays, I′m a new prophet, ayy
Game dead, no autopsy, ayy
City girl with they new hobby, ayy
Catch a body, put the Prada in the ta-da
Nigga 'bout to get some pussy, give me five (give me five)
Gun dirty, got the 30 in the purse, purse
Tight bitch, put a perky in her salad

I gotta pray for the basic
I never seen my niggas bust down faces
Them niggas not tasteless
I only had one chance, I ain′t even waste it
Been down on my luck
Been down on my luck when I fa-a-all
I gotta get up
I gotta get back up and ba-a-a-all

R.I.P., under my people, I'm proud of my people, I′m proud of my dawgs
My ex got a Beamer, she want me to see it
I still ain't gon' see it, like, "okay"
I love when they ratchet, I don′t do her Patek
I still do the watches the old way
She think I′m conceited, I'm thinkin′ 'bout cheatin′
I don't do the flowers or roleplay

Now, how can I fold lookin′ at 20 million
This money don't come with a probay
Mama, I said it'd be okay
I got this shit brackin′ in four days
Four eyes, four eyes, two eyes
Switch sides, nigga be fresh out
Suicide doors, I suicide, suicide
Lambo′ body, who gon' stop me?
Baby Keem is too wild
Function at the tempo
Jesus pieces in the luau
Mr. Morale
Kendrick made you think about it, but he is not your savior
Cole made you feel empower, but he is not your savior
Future said, "Get a money counter," but he is not your savior′Bron made you give his flowers, but he is not your savior
He is not your savior

Mr. Morale, give me high-five, two times
Center co-defendant judging my life
Back peddler, what they say? You do the cha-cha
I'ma stand on it, 6′5", from 5'5"
Fun fact, I ain't taking shit back
Like it when they pro-black, but I′m more Kodak Black
Tell me where the money at, ayy, where the homies at?
Universal callout, I can members only that, ayy

Si-si, wait a minute
Ven aquí (ven aquí), c′est la vie (c'est la vie)
I tell the whole truth from A to Z, ayy
Show me you real, show me that you bleed, ayy
Hello? Crackers? (Let me hear that back)
I seen n- arguing about who′s blacker
Even blacked out screens and called it solidarity
Meditating in silence, made you wanna tell on me

Are you happy for me?
Really, are you happy for me?
Smile on my face, but are you happy for me? Yeah
I'm out the way, are you happy for me?
Are you happy for me?
Really, are you happy for me?
Smile on my face, but are you happy for me? Yeah
I′m out the way, are you happy for me? (High up)

Bite they tongues in rap lyrics
Scared to be crucified about a song but they won't admit it
Politically correct is how you keep an opinion
N- is tight lipped, f- who dare to be different
Seen a Christian say the vaccine mark of the beast
Then he caught COVID and prayed the Pfizer for relief
Then I caught COVID and started to question Kyrie
Will I stay organic or hurt in this bed for two weeks? (You really wanna know?)

Do you want peace? (How I get so low?)
Then watch us in the streets (only one way to go)
One protest for you (high up)
365 for me (you really wanna know?)
Vladimir making nightmares (how I get so low?)
But that′s how we all think (only one way to go)
The collective conscious (high up)
Calamities on repeat, huh

Are you happy for me?
Really, are you happy for me?
Smile on my face, but are you happy for me? Yeah
I'm out the way, are you happy for me?
Are you happy for me?
Really, are you happy for me?
Smile on my face, but are you happy for me? Yeah
I'm out the way, are you happy for me?

Truth, it resides in the fire
The need of it′s dire
Deceiving the lies, I know
Truth, it resides in the fire
The need of it′s dire
Deceiving the lies, I know

The cat is out the bag, I am not your savior
I find it just as difficult to love thy neighbors
Especially when people got ambiguous favors
But they hearts not in it, see, everything's for the paper
The struggle for the right side of history
Independent thought is like an eternal enemy
Capitalist posing as compassionates be offending me
Yeah, suck my d-, with authenticity

Yeah, Tupac dead, gotta think for yourself
Yeah, hero′s looking for the villains to help
I never been sophisticated, same face
Being manipulative such a required taste
I rubbed elbows with people that was for the people
They all greedy, I don't care for no public speaking
And they like to wonder where I′ve been
Protecting my soul in the valley of silence
Heart plays in ways the mind can′t figure out
Heart plays in ways the mind can't figure out
Heart plays in ways the mind can′t figure outThis is how we conceptualize human beings

My auntie is a man now
I think I'm old enough to understand now
Drinking Paul Masson with her hat turned backwards
Motorola pager off like, "Yes, Jackie"
Blue Air Max's, gold chains and curl kits
′93 Nissan wax job, the earliest
Big social, big personality, vocal
Played underground verbatim and stayed local

My auntie is a man now
I watch him and his girl hold their hands down
Tip of the avenues under street lights made his
Thinkin′, "I want me a bad bitch when I get big"
They walk the corner like California king
Cold hand all up her skirt, cars whistling down the road
See, my auntie is a man now, slight bravado
Scratching the likes from lotto
Hoping that she pull up tomorrow
So I can hang out in the front seat
Six by nines, keeping the music up under me

My auntie is a man now
I asked my momma why my uncles don't like him that much
And at the parties why they always wanna fight him that much
She said, "Ain′t no telling"
"Niggas always been jealous because he had more women"
"More money and more attention made more envy"
"Calling him anything but broke was less offendin'"

My auntie is a man now
I think I′m old enough to understand now
Drinking Paul Masson with her hat turned backwards
Back when it was comedic relief to say "faggot"
Faggot, faggot, faggot, we ain't know no better
Elementary kids with no filter, however
My auntie became a man and I took pride in it
She wasn′t gay, she ate pussy, and that was the difference
That's what I told my friends in second grade
She picking me up from school, they stare at her in the face
They couldn't comprehend what I grew accustomed
We pull off bumpin′ quick like it was nothing

My auntie is a man now, what a relationship
I grew up fast, I needed no one to babysit
He gave me some cash, then gave me some gang
Cherry freshener on the dash, I never complained
She even cut my hair at the pad, was loving my fade
The first person I seen write a rap, that′s when my life had changed

House full of demo, smoke stuck on the window
Cameras on the microphone, all women and men though
My auntie was a man now, we cool with it
The history had trickled down and made us ig'nant
My favorite cousin said he′s returning the favor
And following my auntie with the same behavior

Demetrius is Mary-Ann now
He's more confident to live his plan now
But the family in disbelief this time
Convincing themselves, "He ain′t living discreet, he's fine"
They said they never seen it in him, but I seen it
The Barbie dolls played off the reflection of Venus

He built a wall so tall you couldn′t climb over
He didn't laugh as hard when the kids start jokin'
"Faggot, faggot, faggot," we ain′t know no better
Middle school kids with no filter, however
I had to be very mindful of my good cousin
I knew exactly who he was, but I still loved him

Demetrius is Mary-Ann now
I mean he′s really Mary-Ann, even took things further
Changed his gender, before Bruce Jenner was certain
Living his truth, even if it meant see a surgeon
We didn't talk for a while, he seemed more distant
Wasn′t comfortable around me, everything was offensive
But I recall we both had a sick sense of humor
Made raw, but time changes all

Demetrius is Mary-Ann now
Remember church, Easter Sunday?
I sat in the pew, you had stronger faith
More spiritual when these dudes were livin' life straight
Which I found ironic ′cause the pastor didn't see him the same
He said my cousin was goin′ through some things
He promised the world we livin' in was an act on abomination and Demetrius was to blame
I knew you was conflicted by the feelings a preacher made
Wonderin' if God still call you a decent man
Still, you found the courage to be subservient just to anoint
Until he singled you out to prove his point, sayin′

"Demetrius is Mary-Ann now"
Church, his auntie is a man now, it hurt
He the most ′cause his belief was close to his words
Forcing me to stand now
I said, "Mr. Preacher man, should we love thy neighbor?"
"The laws of the land or the heart, what's greater?"
"I recognize the study she was taught since birth"
"But that don′t justify the feelings that my cousin preserved"

The building was thinking out loud, bad angel
That's when you looked at me and smiled, said, "Thank you"
The day I chose humanity over religion
The family got closer, it was all forgiven
I said them F-bombs, I ain′t know any better
Mistakenly, I didn't think you′d know any different
See, I was taught words was nothing more than a sound
If everything was pronounced without any intentions

If every second, you challenge the shit I was kicking
Reminded me about a show I did out the city
That time I brung a fan on stage to rap
But disapproved the word that she couldn't say with me
You said, "Kendrick, ain't no room for contradiction"
"To truly understand love, switch position"
"Faggot, faggot, faggot," we can say it together
But only if you let a white girl say, "Nigga"
It was one of the worst performances I′ve seen in my life
I couldn't sleep last night because I felt this sh-
Ooh, ah, ooh, ahOoh, ah, ah, ooh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yee!

Enoch, your father′s just detoxed, my callin' is right on time
Transformation, I must have a thousand lives
And like three thousand wives
You should know that I'm slightly off writin′ off demons that been outside
Better known as myself, I′m a demigod
Every thought is creative, sometimes I'm afraid of my open mind

On my mind and it′s heavy
Tear you in pieces 'cause it′s way too heavy
My diamonds, the choker is heavy
More life to give on demand, are you ready?
Who keep 'em honest like us?
Who in alignment like us?
Who gotta heal ′em all? Us (us)
When there's no one to call

Don't need no conversation
It ain′t about the business, shut the door now
It′s a celebration
And if this sh- ain't bussin′, what's it for now?

Steppin′ out when the weight lifts
Floatin' on ′em (ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)
Floatin' on 'em (float, float, ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)
Floatin′ on ′em (float, float, ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)
Floatin' on ′em (float, ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)
Steppin' out when the weight lifts
Floatin′ on 'em (ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)
Floatin′ on 'em (float, float, ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)
Floatin' on ′em (float, float, ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)
Floatin′ on 'em (float, float, ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)

Uzi, your father′s in deep meditation
My spirit's awaken, my brain is asleep
I got a new temperature
Sharpenin′ multiple swords in the faith I believe
I think about Robert Kelly
If he weren't molested, I wonder if life′ll fail him
I wonder if Oprah found closure
The way that she postered the hurt that a women carries

My mother abused young
Like all of them others back were we from
SSI bury family members
At the repass, they servin' Popeyes chicken
What you know about Black trauma?
F&Ns, kickin' back is another genre
Tyler Perry, the face of a thousand rappers
Using violence to cover what really happen

I know somebody′s listenin′
Past life regressions to know my conditions
It's based of experience
Comma for comma, my habits insensitive
Watchin′ my cousin struggle with addiction
Then watchin' her firstborn make a million
And both of them off the grid for forgiveness
I′m sacrificin' myself to start the healin′ and

On my mind and it's heavy
Tear you in pieces 'cause it′s way too heavy
My diamonds, the choker is heavy
More life to give on demand, are you ready
Who keep ′em honest like us?
Who in alignment like us?
Who gotta heal 'em all? Us (us)
When there′s no one to call us (us)

Say, "Hydrate, it's time to heal"
Safe, you′re frustrated, I can feel
Huddle up, tie the flag, call the troops, holler back
Huddle up, tie the flag
Call the troops, holler back (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

People get taken over by this pain-body
Because this energy field that almost has a life of its own
It needs to, periodically, feed on more unhappiness

We do not have the lyrics for Kendrick Lamar x Cashmere Cat Mirror Vibe yet.
As I get a little older, I realize life is perspective
And my perspective may differ from yours
I wanna say thank you to everyone that′s been down with meAll my fans, all my beautiful fans
Anyone who's ever gave me a listen, all my people

I come from a generation of pain, where murder is minor
Rebellious and Margielas′ll chip you for designer
Belt buckles and clout, overzealous if prone to violence
Make the wrong turn, be a will of the wheel alignment

Residue burned, missed at a inner-city
Miscommunication to keep homi' detective busy
No protection is risky
Desensitized, I vandalized pain
Covered up and camouflaged
Get used to hearin' arsenal rain

Analyze, risk your life, take the charge
Homies done fucked your baby mama once you hit the yard, that′s culture
Twenty-three hour lockdown, then somebody called
Said your lil′ nephew was shot down, the culture's involved

I done seen niggas do seventeen, hit the halfway house
Get out and get his brains blown out, lookin′ to buy some weed
Car wash is played out, new GoFundMe accounts'll proceed
A brand-new victim′ll shatter those dreams, the culture

(I want, I want, I want, I want)
But I want you to want me too (I want, I want, I want, I want)
I want the hood to want me back (I want, I want, I want, I want)
I want the hood
Look what I done for you (look what I done for you)
Look what I done for you

I said I do this for my culture
To let y'all know what a nigga look like in a bulletproof Rover
In my mama′s sofa was a doo-doo popper
Head tricker, walk up closer
Ain't no Photoshoppin'

Friends bipolar, grab you by your pockets
No option if you froze up, always play the offense
Niggas goin′ to work and sellin′ work, late for work
Workin' late, prayin′ for work, but he on paperwork
That's the culture, point the finger, promote ya
Remote location, witness protection, they gon′ hold ya

The streets got me fucked up, y'all can miss me
I wanna represent for us
New revolution was up and movin′
I'm in Argentina wiping my tears full of confusion
Water in between us, another peer's been executed
History repeats again
Make amends, then find a nigga with the same skin to do it

But that′s the culture, crack a bottle
Hard to deal with the pain when you′re sober
By tomorrow, we forget the remains, we start over
That's the problem
Our foundation was trained to accept whatever follows
Dehumanize, insensitive
Scrutinize the way we live for you and I

Enemies shook my hand, I can promise I′ll meet you
In a land where no equal is your equal
Never say I ain't told ya, nah
In the land where hurt people hurt more people
Fuck callin′ it culture

(I want, I want, I want, I want)
But I want you to want me too (I want, I want, I want, I want)
I want the hood to want me back (I want, I want, I want, I want)
I want the hood
Look what I done for you (look what I done for you)
Look what I done for you

Take the drums out

Celebrate new life when it come back around
The purpose is in the lessons we learnin' now
Sacrifice personal gain over everything
Just to see the next generation better than ours
I wasn′t perfect, the skin I was in had truly suffered

Temptation and patience, everything that the body nurtures
I felt the good, I felt the bad, and I felt the worry
But all-in-all, my productivity had stayed urgent
Face your fears, always knew that I would make it here
Where the energy is magnified and persevered

Consciousness is synchronized and crystal clear
Euphoria is glorified and made His
Reflectin' on my life and what I done
Paid dues, made rules, change outta love
Them same views made schools change curriculums
But didn't change me starin′ down the barrel of that gun

Should I feel resentful I didn′t see my full potential?
Should I feel regret about the good that I was into?
Everything is everything, this ain't coincidental
I woke up that morning with more heart to give you
As I bleed through the speakers, feel my presence

To my brother, to my kids, I′m in Heaven
To my mother, to my sis, I'm in Heaven
To my father, to my wife, I am serious, this is Heaven
To my friends, make sure you countin′ them blessings
To my fans, make sure you make them investments

And to the killer that sped up my demise
I forgive you, just know your soul's in question
I seen the pain in your pupil when that trigger had squeezed
And though you did me gruesome, I was surely relieved
I completed my mission, wasn′t ready to leave
But fulfilled my days, my Creator was pleased

I can't stress how I love y'all
I don′t need to be in flesh just to hug y′all
The memories recollect just because y'all
Celebrate me with respect
The unity we protect is above all

And Sam, I′ll be watchin' over you
Make sure my kids watch all my interviews
Make sure you live all the dreams we produce
Keep that genius in your brain on the move
And to my neighborhood, let the good prevail
Make sure them babies and the leaders outta jail

Look for salvation when troubles get real
′Cause you can't help the world until you help yourself
And I can′t blame the hood the day that I was killed
Y'all had to see it, that's the only way to feel
And though my physical won′t reap the benefits
The energy that carry on emits still

I want you
I hope you find some peace of mind in this lifetime
Tell them, tell ′em, tell them the truth
I hope you find some paradise (tell them, tell 'em the truth)Tell ′em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell them your-

I′ve been goin′ through somethin'
One thousand, eight hundred and 55 days
I′ve been goin' through somethin′
Be afraid

What is a bitch in a miniskirt?
A man in his feelings with bitter nerve
What is a woman that really hurt?
A demon, you're better off killin′ her
What is a relative, making repetitive narratives on how you did it first?
That is a predator, hit reverse
All of your presidents evil thirst

What is a neighborhood rep'table?
That is a snitch on a pedestal
What is a house with a better view?
A family broken in variables
What is a rapper with jewelry?
A way that I show my maturity
What if I call on security?
That mean I'm calling on God for purity

I went and got me a therapist
I can debate on my theories and sharing it (whoa)
Consolidate all my comparisons
Humblin′ up because time was imperative (whoa)
Started to feel like it′s only one answer to everything, I don't know where it is (whoa)
Popping a bottle of Claritin (whoa)
Is it my head or my arrogance? (Whoa)

Shaking and moving, like, what am I doing? I′m flipping my time through the Rolodex
Indulging myself and my life and my music, the world that I'm in is a cul-de-sac
The world that we in is just menacing, the demons portrayed religionous
I wake in the morning, another appointment, I hope the psychologist listenin′

The new Mercedes with black G Wagon
The "Where you from?" It was all for rap
I was 28 years young, twenty mill' in tax
Bought a couple of mansions just for practice
Five hundred in jewelry, chain was magic
Never had it in public, late reaction
50K to cousins, post a caption
Pray none of my enemies hold me captive

I grieve different

I grieve different
Huh

I met her on the third night of Chicago
North America tour, my enclave
Fee-fi-fo-fum, she was a model
Dedicated to the songs I wrote and the Bible
Eyes like green, penetratin′ the moonlight
Hair done in a bun, energy in the room like
Big Bang for theory, God, hopin' you hear me
Phone off the ringer, tell the world I'm busy

Fair enough, green eyes said her mother didn′t care enough
Sympathize when her daddy in the chain gang
Her first brother got killed, he was 21
I was nine when they put Lamont in the grave
Heartbroken when Estelle didn′t say goodbye
Chad left his body after we FaceTimed
Green eyes said you'd be okay, first tour, sex the pain away

I grieve different

I grieve different
Huh

The new Mercedes with black G Wagon
The "Where you from?" It was all for rap
I was 28 years young, twenty mill′ in tax
Bought a couple of mansions just for practice

50K to cousins, post a caption
Pray none of my enemies hold me captive

So what? Paralyzed, the county building controlled us
I bought a Rolex watch, I only wore it once
I bought infinity pools, I never swimmed in
I watched Keem buy four cars in four months
You know the family dynamic's on repeat
The insecurities locked down on PC
I bought a .223, nobody peace treat
You won′t doo-doo me, I smell TNT

Dave got him a Porsche, so I got me a Porsche
Paid lottery for it, I ain't want it in portions
Poverty was the case
But the money wipin′ the tears away

I grieve different
Everybody grieves different
Everybody grieves different
I grieve different
Huh
Hello, new world
All the boys and girls
I got some true stories to tellYou′re back outside
But they still lied
Whoa-oh-oh-oh (yeah)

Take off the foo-foo, take off the clout chase, take off the Wi-Fi
Take off the money phone, take off the car loan, take off the flex and the white lies
Take off the weird ass jewelry, I'ma take ten steps, then I′m takin' off top five
Take off them fabricated streams and them microwave memes, it's a real world outside (take that shit off)

Take off your idols, take off the runway, I take off to Cairo (take that shit off)
Take off to Saint-Tropez, five-day stay, take a quarter mill′, hell, if I know (take that shit off)
Take off the front flag, take off perception, take off the cop with the eye patch (take that shit off)
Take off the unloyal, take off the unsure, take off decisions I lack (take it off)

Take off the fake deep, take off the fake woke, take off the, "I′m broke, I care" (take it off)
Take off the gossip, take off the new logic that if I'm rich, I′m rare (take it off)
Take off the Chanel, take off the Dolce, take off the Birkin bag (take it off)
Take all that designer bullshit off, and what do you have?

Bitch, huh-huh

Huh, two ATMs, you steppin' or what? (You outta pocket)
Huh, who you think they talk about? Talk about us (shoot, shoot, shoot, you out of pocket)
Who you think they copy off? Copy off us (get back in pocket)

The world in a panic, the women is stranded, the men on a run
The prophets abandoned, the law take advantage, the market is crashin′, the industry wants
Niggas and bitches to sleep in a box while they makin' a mockery followin′ us
This ain't Monopoly, watchin' for love
This ain′t monogamy, y′all gettin' fucked

Jumping on, "What the hell is that?" I gotta relax when I feel (huh, facts)
All my decendents, they come in my sleep and say I am too real (huh, facts)
I′m done with the sensitive, takin' it personal
Done with the black and the white, the wrong and the right
You hopin′ for change and clericals, I know the feelings that came with burial's cries

Bitch, huh-huh
Ugh, you ugly as fuck (you outta pocket)
Huh, two ATMs, you steppin′ or what? (You outta pocket)
Huh, who you think they talk about? Talk about us (shoot, shoot, shoot, you out of pocket)
Who you think they copy off? Copy off us (get back in pocket)

Servin' up a look, dancin' in the drought
Hello to the big stepper, never losin′ count
Ventin′ in the safe house, ventin' in the sa-

Can I vent all my truth? I got nothin′ to lose
I got problems and pools, I can swim in my faith
Camera's movin′ whenever I'm movin′
The family suin' whatever I make
Murder is stackin', the president actin′
The government taxin′ my funds in a bank
Homies attractin' the feds when I′m brackin'
Look at my reaction, my pupils on skates (hol′ up, hol' up)

Let′s think about this for a second (let's go)
Tell me what you would do for aesthetic (let's go)
Would you sell your soul on credit? (Let′s go)
Would you sell your bro for leverage? (Let′s go)

Where the hypocrites at?
What community feel they the only ones relevant? (Go)
Where the hypocrites at?
What community feel they the only ones relevant? (Go, huh-huh-huh)

You outta pocket, yeah, you outta pocket (this shit hard)
You entertain the mediocre, need to stop it (this shit hard)
You entertainin' old friends when they toxic (this shit hard)
What′s your life like? Bullshit and gossip (this shit hard)
What the fuck is cancel culture, dawg?
Say what I want about you niggas, I'm like Oprah, dawg
I treat you crackers like I′m Jigga, watch, I own it all
Oh, you worried 'bout a critic? That ain′t protocol (bitch)
Kodak Black, Oklama
Eckhart Tolle
And this here is the big stepper
I′m a killer, he's a killer, she′s a killer
We some killers, walkin' zombies, tryna scratch that itch
Germophobic, hetero and

I am not for the faint of heart
My genetic build can build multi-universes, the man of God
Playin' "Baby Shark" with my daughter
Watchin′ for sharks outside at the same time
Life as a protective father, I′d kill for her
My son Enoch is the part two
When I expire, my children'll make higher valleys
In this present moment, I saw that through

Ask Whitney about my lust addiction
Text messaging bitches got my thumbs hurt
Set precedent for a new sacrilegion
Writer′s block for two years, nothin' moved me
Asked God to speak through me, that′s what you hearin' now
The voice of yours truly
Teleport out my own body for comfort

I don′t pass judgment, past life regressions keep me in question
Where did I come from? I don't think like I used to
No, I don't blink like I used to
Awkward stares at everybody, see the flesh of man
But still, this man compared to nobody
Yesterday, I prayed to the flowers and trees
Gratification to the powers that be
Synchronization with my energy chakras, the ghost of Dr. Sebi
Paid it forward, cleaned out my toxins, bacteria heavy
Sciatica nerve pinch, I don′t know how to feel
Like the first time I fucked a white bitch

The first time I fucked a white bitch
I was sixteen at the Palisades
Fumbling my grades, I traveled with the team
The apache life, Centennial was like
When Mrs. Baker screamed at Doughboy
Mixed that with Purple Rain
They interchanged the scenes
Happy just to be out the hood
With all the wealthy kids

Credit cards and family plans
She drove her daddy′s Benz
I found out that he was a sheriff
That was a win-win
Because he had locked up Uncle Perry
She paid her daddy's sins

Next time I fucked a white bitch
Was out in Copenhagen
Good kid, m.A.A.d city tour
I flourished on them stages
Whitney asked did I have a problem
I said, "I might be racist"
Ancestors watchin′ me fuck was like retaliation

I'm a killer, he′s a killer, she's a killer
We some killers, walkin′ zombies, tryna scratch that itch
Germophobic, hetero and homophobic
Photoshopping lies and motives
Hide your eyes, then pose for the pic

What the-

Eight billion people on Earth, silent murderers
Non-profits, preachers and church, crooks and burglars (woo)
Hollywood corporate in school, teachin' philosophies
You either gon' be dead or in jail, killer psychology

Silent murderer, what′s your body count? Who your sponsorship?
Objectified so many bitches, I killed their confidence (what the)
The media′s the new religion, you killed the consciousness (what the)
Your jealousy is way too pretentious, you killed accomplishments (what the)
Niggas killed freedom of speech, everyone sensitive (what the)
If your opinion fuck 'round and leak, might as well send your will (what the)
The industry has killed the creators, I′ll be the first to say (what the)
To each exec', "I′m saving your children", we can't negotiate (what the)

I caught a couple of bodies myself, slid my community
My last Christmas toy drive in Compton handed out eulogies
Not because the rags in the park had red gradient
But because the high blood pressure flooded the caterin′
So what's the difference 'tween your life when hiding motives?
More fatalities and reality bring you closure
The noble person that goes to work and pray like they ′posed to?
Slaughter people too, your murder′s just a bit slower

I'm a killer, he′s a killer, she's a killer (what the)
We some killers, walkin′ zombies, tryna scratch that itch (what the)
Germophobic, hetero and homophobic
Photoshopping lies and motives
Hide your eyes, then pose for the pic
I pop the pain away, I slide the pain away
I pop the pain away, I slide the pain away
I picked you up when you fell and cut your kneeI told you not to cry and held you close to me

I hope I′m not too late to set my demons straight
I know I made you wait, but how much can you take?
I hope you see the God in me, I hope you can see
And if it's up, stay down for me, yeah

Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa pop
Serafina, flame in ice
Where I′d be without your love
Rest your wings and trust, I feel you

Deep (I know you feel), deep (know you feel)
Deep (I know you feel), deep (too deep)
Deep (I know you feel), deep (know you feel)
Deep (I know you feel), deep

Do you love me? (Okay) Do you trust me? (Okay)
Can I trust you? (Okay) Don't judge me (okay)
I'ma die hard, it gets ugly (okay)
Too passionate, it gets ugly (okay)
Mmm, ah-ah
I wonder where I lost my way
Mmm, ah-ah
Been waiting on your call all day

Tell me you in my corner right now
When I fall short, I′m leaning on you to cry out
We all got enough to lie about
My truth too complicated to hide now
Can I open up? Is it safe or not?
I′m afraid a little, you relate or not?
Have faith a little, I might take my time
Ain't no saving face this time

I hope I′m not too late to set my demons straight
I know I made you wait, but how much can you take?
I hope you see the God in me, I hope you can see
And if it's up, stay down for me, yeah

Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa pop
Serafina, flame in ice
Where I′d be without your love
Rest your wings and trust, I feel you

Deep (I know you feel), deep (know you feel)
Deep (I know you feel), deep (too deep)
Deep (I know you feel), deep (know you feel)
Deep (I know you feel), deep

I got some regrets (I-I-I, yeah, yeah)
But my past won't keep me from my best (I-I-I, yeah, yeah)
Subtle mistakes felt like life or death (I-I-I, yeah, yeah)
I wanna see the family stronger
I wanna see the money longer
You know that I′d die for you (I'd die for you)

I get emotional about life
The lost ones keepin' me up at night
The world be reminding me it′s danger
I′ll still risk it all for a stranger
If I told you who I am, would you use it against me?
Right or wrong, no stone, just love to send me

I hope I'm not too late to set my demons straight
I know I made you wait, but how much can you take?
I hope you see the God in me, I hope you can see
And if it′s up, stay down for me, yeah

Baby, you make me pray for London
Yeah, 'cause if I won it all without you involved
I guess it′s all for nothing

I learned in trappin′, in the business
Smart people makin' horrible decisions, you know?
Rich nigga, gettin′ my dick sucked after the showI ain't gonna lie, we were poor
A bunch of lost souls in survival mode
It wasn't no way for us unless we find our own

Runnin′ in stores, kickin′ in doors, nigga, give me my glory
Nigga play with me, he ain't gon′ live to tell the story
You know, this the type of shit we glorify
Everybody "gang-gang"
Most of the people that you grew up with are now in chain gang
In the box, gettin' pink

Niggas shittin′ where you sleep
Nigga shittin' where you eat
Who′da ever knew that I'd become a fuckin' Kodak? Yeah
Rap money good but I′m still pumpin′ aas through the hood
Droppin' off plates to the fam′ like Thanksgivin'
Got the baby snipers standin′ on that murk business, yeah, slidin' for Yak
They ready for whatever

I always knew that everything would get better
And it sure got greater later
All the game came from the elders like hand-me-downs
Me and my brothers wearin′ hand-me-downs
Now I'm givin' game back to the old heads
And the respect come first, yeah, you know?

Can′t be better than the OGs
You gotta get it somewhere
Gotta come from somethin′
Gotta come from nothin'
We ain′t seen this comin'
It′s more than a blessin'

What you doing with Kendrick? (Ooh, ooh)
What you doing with a legend? (Ooh, ooh)
So, what they call you? (Ooh, ooh)
When it′s all said and done, we ain't leavin' empty handed (ooh, ooh)
That′s on gang (ooh, ooh)
That′s on Ma' Dukes (ooh, ooh)
Poorer than that bitch but she fall through (ooh, ooh)
Makin′ ends meet (ooh, ooh)

Had to steal for a meal or you can't eat, you know? (Ooh, ooh)
Poverty (ooh, ooh)
Red Cross, food banks, W.I.C. (ooh, ooh)
Now look at this shit, we own property
Takin′ my baby to school, then I pray for her
'Cause you bitches ain′t never been cool, writin' testament
Paintin' pictures, put me in the Louvre, that′s a definiteUniversal shift, I′m in a groove and celebrity do not mean integrity, you fool
I'm a good man, shakin′ hand, firm grip rule
72 ways, lost ten, ballin' with the flu
More than two M′s for a show, but add another two
Hmm, lil' Man-Man, the big mans, the GT diamond flippin′ the kickstand (ooh)

Rich nigga, broke phone (ah)

The morality can wait, feedback on low latency
I'm glitchin′ from the face as my thoughts grow sacredly
I'm runnin′ out of space, ask Whitney she okay
Never mind a hundred K, why you lyin' on Benjamin?
He turnin′ in his grave
I'd be lyin' if I said I wouldn′t give this shit away
The aloof Buddha, I′m Christ with a shooter
Praise to Muhammad, I might nigga-news you

AP Michael Freeman, my friends cooler
Primary, so the resale value stupid
I would never live my life on the computer
IG'll get you life for a chikabooya
More power to ya, love ′em from a distance
Why you always in the mirror more than the bitches?
And my cousin tried to sue me like he got the privilege
But I didn't lose sleep ′cause I got the spirit, ayy (ooh)

Rich nigga, broke phone (ah)

F- me

Stop tap-dancing around the conversation
Mmm, tippy-toeing and I′m mud-walkin', hmm
Rollin′ sevens, I ain't ready for no coffin
I know y'all love it when the drugs talkin′, butShut the f- up when you hear love talkin′
Shut the f- up when you hear love talkin'
If God be the source then I am the plug talkin′
Yeah, baby, yeah, baby
Yeah, baby, yeah, baby

This my undisputed truth, uh-huh
My life is like forbidden fruit, my b- know better than I do
A woman's worth, I barely went to church
I′d rather fast with you than f- it up
F- with skirts 'cause I′m rational
A n- still gon' be a-, emoji heart, my family pictures
Two-steppin' away from rappers, I don′t trust their true intentions
I′m not in the music business, I been in the human business
Whole life been social distant, h- like, "When you not trippin'?"

I duck the party, who said they saw me?
Crown on Bob Marley, wrist on Yo Gotti
They gon′ judge your life for a couple likes on the double tap
Them h- is sorry, they all get bodied
I bless it that you have an open heart, I bless that you forgive
I bless it that you can learn from a loss, I bless it that you heal
I bless one day that you attract somebody with your mind exact
A patient life, flaws, bless 'em twice, and they′ll bless you back

Tippy-toeing and I'm mud-walkin′, hmm
Rollin' sevens, I ain't ready for no coffin
I know y′all love it when the drugs talkin′, but
Shut the f- up when you hear love talkin'
Shut the f- up when you hear love talkin′
If God be the source, then I am the plug talkin'
Yeah, baby, yeah, baby
Yeah, baby, yeah

How′s love when it's heart to your soul?
But my - left, his - on the road
Gossiping ′bout some sh- you don't know
Oh, you ho (yeah, yeah, yeah) fo' sure
I hate it here, baby daddy still on my phone
I hate it here, asking if I been on the pole
I hate it here, if you keep lurking on the low
If you a fan, just let me know
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)

Now if it′s love, I deserve to get some - on a balcony sometimes, sometimes
And if I feel where your heart can be, you′ll still be a part of me
I love mine, love mine (love mine, love mine)
Summer in the storm, I cannot conform
(I cannot conform, I cannot conform)
I just might love you still, just think I love me more
It ain't love if you gon′ judge me for my past
No, it ain't love if you ain′t never eat my -
It ain't love if you just only tie me down because you seen me in my bag
That′s why I'm anti-everyone before this mask

Mmm, tippy-toeing and I'm mud-walkin′, hmm
Rollin′ sevens, I ain't ready for no coffin
I know y′all love it when the drugs talkin', but
Shut the f- up when you hear love talkin′
Shut the f- up when you hear love talkin'
If God be the source, then I am the plug talkin′
Yeah, baby, yeah, baby
Yeah, baby, yeah

Yo, yo
Telekinesis, I'm purifying these D speeches
While I'm crying, I clean the feet of the sweet Jesus
Dreams, visions get blurry of the Elohim, it′s light
It′s known to tear retinas in a single gleam
Shut the f- up when you hear His love talkin'
To the mind, it′s God's cypher divine in a small portion, uh
Faded pictures, this global madness, the intervention
This world′s in The Twilight Zone, this is the fifth dimension

God, please blow the whistle, we need an intermission
My good deeds in front of your door, I'm standing by the entrance
With heavy baggage, my brother′s ashes
I seen tragic, I did dirt, smacked death and held it to that - cabbage
Love, we killin' greed, we killin' homelessness
And I don′t give a - about this land, I want ownership
Bow your head for just God′s sake
Listen what the stars say when I say it's God′s way

Tippy-toeing and I'm mud-walkin′, hmm
Rollin' sevens, I ain′t ready for no coffin
I know y'all love it when the drugs talkin', but
Shut the f- up when you hear love talkin′
Shut the f- up when you hear love talkin′
If God be the source, then I am the plug talkin'
Yeah, baby, yeah, baby
Yeah, baby, yeah, baby
We may not know which way to go on this dark road

(Mr. Duckworth)All of these hoes make it difficult

Session ten, breakthrough

One of these lives, I′ma make things right
With the wrongs I've done, that′s one of you now
With the Father, Son, 'til then, I fight
Rain on me, put the blame on me
Got guilt, got hurt, got shame on me
Got six magazines that's aimed at me
Done every magazine, what′s fame to me?

It′s a game to me, where the bedroom at? (And I'm tripping and falling)
Sleep, I ain′t never had affairs with that
What's fed when the hearts and the words don′t reach?
What's fair when the money don′t take things back?
It's rare when somebody take your dreams back

I care too much, wanna share too much (and I'm tripping and falling)
In my head too much, I shut down too
I ain′t there too much, I′m a complex soul
They layered me up, then broke me down
And morality's dust, I lack in trust

This time around, I trust myself (and I′m tripping and falling)
Please everybody else but myself
All else fails, I was myself
Outdone fear, outdone myself
This year, you better one yourself

Masks on the babies, mask on an opp (and I'm tripping and falling)
Wear masks in the neighborhood stores you shop
But a mask won′t hide who you are inside
Look around, the reality's carved in the lies
Wipe my ego, dodge my pride

Look myself in the mirror (and I′m tripping and falling)
Amityville, I ain't seen nothing scarier (on and on and on and on)
I fought like a Pitbull Terrier, blood I shed could fill up aquariums
Tell all my angels, "Carry 'em" (and I′m tripping and falling)
Every emotion been deprived, even my strong points couldn′t survive
If I didn't learn to love myself, forgive myself a hundred times, dawg

I love when you count me out (huh)
I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out (brrah, ooh, brrah, ooh, brrah)
I love when you count me out (brrah, ooh, brrah, ooh, brrah)
Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fucking it up
How you gon′ win my trust when the lies run deep? (Brrah, ooh, brrah)
How you gon' bend your love when the bad don′t sleep?
Beep, beep, crash our feelings in the middle of the street (vroom, vroom)
Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fucking it up

When you was at your lowest, tell me, where the hoes was at?
When you was at your lowest, tell me, where the bros was at?
3:30 in the morning, scroll through the call log
Ain't nobody but the mirror looking for the fall off (brrr)

I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out (brrah, ooh, brrah, ooh, brrah)
My name is in your mouth, shoo, shoo

It′s gon' take more than pride to stop
Call 911, I caught a body
Sun up now, yesterday is fading
Healing's only one mile away

Let me tell you ′bout the women I know (that′s my baby)
I know karma like to follow us strong (sheesh)
I know millionaires that feel alone (sheesh)
Anytime I couldn't find God, I still could find myself through a song
Many find they life in a phone

Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fucking it up

You said I′d feel better if I just worked hard
Without lifting my head up, that left me fed up
You made me worry, I wanted my best version
But you ignored me, then changed the story
Then changed the story

Good energy in the room, drop the location, please
Antibiotic for the womb when I'm frustrated, please
(Antibiotic for the womb when I′m frustrated)
Tryna keep my good conscious in rotation (no, no)
Thoughts in my head, they living there with no (tryna keep my good)

I made a decision, never give you my feelings
Fuck with you from, fuck with you from a distance
Some put it on the devil when they fall short
I put it on my ego, lord of all lords
Sometimes I fall for her, dawg

I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out (sheesh)
I love when you count me out (sheesh)
I love when you count me out (brrah, ooh, brrah, ooh, brrah)
My name is in your mouth
Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fucking it up (shoo, shoo)

Miss Regrets, I believe that you done me wrong (Miss Regrets)
Miss Regrets, can you please exit out my home? (Miss Regrets)
Miss Regret, I think I'm better off alone (Miss Regrets)
Miss Regret, Miss Regret, I got these deep regrets

(And I′m tripping and falling) some things I can't forget
Lord knows, I tried my best, you said it's not my best
I came up out my flesh
Some things I must confess (and I′m tripping and falling)
Spoke my truth, paid my debt, can′t you see I'm a wreck? (Ah-yah)
Let me lose, I digress, this is me and I′m blessed (ah-yah, ah-yah)

This is me and I'm blessed (ah-yah)
This is me and I′m blessed (ah-yah)
This is me and I'm blessed (ah-yah)
Anybody fighting through the stress? (Ah-yah)
Anybody fighting through the-
You walk around, like everything is in control
Favor come with favors and you can′t say no
Go out the way to make the coin availableThat's what I call love

The closest ones afraid to say they need some time
The turnaround is life or death, but you don′t mind
Go out the way to say you made the compromise
That's what I call love

But the time, it'll come to not be there when somebody needs you
You say, "No" and all you′ve done gives them amnesia
One thing I′ve learned, love can change with the seasons

And I can't please everybody
No, I can′t please everybody
Wait, you can't please everybody
No, I can′t please everybody (I can't please everybody)

They idolize and praise your name across the nation
Tap the feed and nod the head for confirmation
Promise that you keep the music in rotation
That′s what I call love (that's what I call love)

But the time, it'll come to not be there when somebody needs you
You say, "No" and all you′ve done gives them amnesia (they don′t remember)
One thing I've learned love can change with the seasons

And I can′t please everybody
No, I can't please everybody
Wait, you can′t please everybody
No, I can't please everybody

And I can′t please everybody
No, I can't please everybody
Wait, you can't please everybody

Pick my daughter up, she need all the love

It's like six o'clock, you talk too much
You makin′ it awkward, love
I mean, it′s hard enough, I mean, it's-

Pull out the stick, hit a b- with the wood
First to park Rolls Royce, 'vert in the hood
Don′t worry about us, over here we good
The AP Roman numeral, everywhere I go, I need pharmaceuticals
I ran my whole conglomerate, I was just mappin sh- out in the cubicle

Suicide coupe was a funeral, Trackhawk launch like a slingshot
Big ol' ruby diamond on my pinky finger, that b- look like a Ring Pop
Money on my mind, money on your head
Can′t ride three times while you comin' through the 'jects
Red Cross kept a- fed
In the studio with K. Dot fresh out the feds

Yeah, you n- can′t stand the rain, don′t stand a chance
Yeah, Chevrolet candy paint, I spin the bend in the Benz
I caught a bale off a Google app
I'm the type to get my shooter whacked
I had to survive off a tuna pack

Five percent tint on the whip like, "Who was that?"
Coupe take off like it′s mad
Beat the d- with a fork, I'm whippin′ up Sudafed, I'm doin′ scams in the lab
Every Thursday, girl's day, spendin' time with my daughter, make me go harder
Every Sunday′s son′s day, teach my boy to be a man, I ain't had no father
Fell in the love with the block, I ain′t have no pop, just a sawed-off shotgun, Mossberg
We stackin' that money up proper, awkward diamonds, look like marbles
Audemars water, aqua, beatin′ the block up 'til we spot ′em
I don't want your ice, boy, I want your life, but-, I still might rob 'em

Stressed out, stressed out, stressed out
If you derive your sense of identity from being a victim
Let′s say, bad things were done to you when you were a child
And you develop a sense of self that is based on the bad things that happened to you
You ever seen your mama strung out while you studied division?
Your uncle ever stole from you, day after Christmas?
Seen both of those in the county jail visits
The first and the fifteenth, the only religion
Noodles in the microwave, shark tank tidal wave
Grandma shooting niggas, blood on the highway
Crosses on the dashboard, you just want a platform
I wanna take everything that I ask for

Catch me a body, I'll put that on anybody but my mama
She showing a pattern for certain
I think it′s white panties and minimal condoms
My uncle would tell me the shit in the movies could only be magic
This year, I did 43 shows and took it all home to buy him a casket
Jack of all trades, got money out the way, put my heart in the faith, I'm good, love

Cousin in the courts, heard he jumped out the porch
Turn a brick to a Porsche, I'm good, love
Catch us, you know I′m gon′ rack up
I need the advance and the equity to match up
The engineer dead if the drive don't back up
These words come from God, you could never outrap us

Nowadays gotta walk cautious, ayy
Nowadays, I′m a new prophet, ayy
Game dead, no autopsy, ayy
City girl with they new hobby, ayy
Catch a body, put the Prada in the ta-da
Nigga 'bout to get some pussy, give me five (give me five)
Gun dirty, got the 30 in the purse, purse
Tight bitch, put a perky in her salad

I gotta pray for the basic
I never seen my niggas bust down faces
Them niggas not tasteless
I only had one chance, I ain′t even waste it
Been down on my luck
Been down on my luck when I fa-a-all
I gotta get up
I gotta get back up and ba-a-a-all

R.I.P., under my people, I'm proud of my people, I′m proud of my dawgs
My ex got a Beamer, she want me to see it
I still ain't gon' see it, like, "okay"
I love when they ratchet, I don′t do her Patek
I still do the watches the old way
She think I′m conceited, I'm thinkin′ 'bout cheatin′
I don't do the flowers or roleplay

Now, how can I fold lookin′ at 20 million
This money don't come with a probay
Mama, I said it'd be okay
I got this shit brackin′ in four days
Four eyes, four eyes, two eyes
Switch sides, nigga be fresh out
Suicide doors, I suicide, suicide
Lambo′ body, who gon' stop me?
Baby Keem is too wild
Function at the tempo
Jesus pieces in the luau
Mr. Morale
Kendrick made you think about it, but he is not your savior
Cole made you feel empower, but he is not your savior
Future said, "Get a money counter," but he is not your savior′Bron made you give his flowers, but he is not your savior
He is not your savior

Mr. Morale, give me high-five, two times
Center co-defendant judging my life
Back peddler, what they say? You do the cha-cha

Hello? Crackers? (Let me hear that back)
I seen n- arguing about who′s blacker
Even blacked out screens and called it solidarity
Meditating in silence, made you wanna tell on me

Are you happy for me?
Really, are you happy for me?
Smile on my face, but are you happy for me? Yeah
I'm out the way, are you happy for me?
Are you happy for me?
Really, are you happy for me?
Smile on my face, but are you happy for me? Yeah
I′m out the way, are you happy for me? (High up)

Bite they tongues in rap lyrics
Scared to be crucified about a song but they won't admit it
Politically correct is how you keep an opinion
N- is tight lipped, f- who dare to be different
Seen a Christian say the vaccine mark of the beast
Then he caught COVID and prayed the Pfizer for relief
Then I caught COVID and started to question Kyrie
Will I stay organic or hurt in this bed for two weeks? (You really wanna know?)

Do you want peace? (How I get so low?)
Then watch us in the streets (only one way to go)
One protest for you (high up)

I'm out the way, are you happy for me?

Truth, it resides in the fire
The need of it′s dire
Deceiving the lies, I know
Truth, it resides in the fire
The need of it′s dire
Deceiving the lies, I know

The cat is out the bag, I am not your savior
I find it just as difficult to love thy neighbors
Especially when people got ambiguous favors
But they hearts not in it, see, everything's for the paper
The struggle for the right side of history
Independent thought is like an eternal enemy
Capitalist posing as compassionates be offending me
Yeah, suck my d-, with authenticity

Yeah, Tupac dead, gotta think for yourself
Yeah, hero′s looking for the villains to help
I never been sophisticated, same face
Being manipulative such a required taste
I rubbed elbows with people that was for the people
They all greedy, I don't care for no public speaking
And they like to wonder where I′ve been
Protecting my soul in the valley of silence
Heart plays in ways the mind can′t figure out
Heart plays in ways the mind can't figure out
Heart plays in ways the mind can′t figure outThis is how we conceptualize human beings

My auntie is a man now
I think I'm old enough to understand now
Drinking Paul Masson with her hat turned backwards
Motorola pager off like, "Yes, Jackie"
Blue Air Max's, gold chains and curl kits
′93 Nissan wax job, the earliest
Big social, big personality, vocal
Played underground verbatim and stayed local

My auntie is a man now
I watch him and his girl hold their hands down
Tip of the avenues under street lights made his
Thinkin′, "I want me a bad bitch when I get big"
They walk the corner like California king
Cold hand all up her skirt, cars whistling down the road
See, my auntie is a man now, slight bravado
Scratching the likes from lotto
Hoping that she pull up tomorrow
So I can hang out in the front seat
Six by nines, keeping the music up under me

My auntie is a man now
I asked my momma why my uncles don't like him that much
And at the parties why they always wanna fight him that much
She said, "Ain′t no telling"
"Niggas always been jealous because he had more women"
"More money and more attention made more envy"
"Calling him anything but broke was less offendin'"

My auntie is a man now
I think I′m old enough to understand now
Drinking Paul Masson with her hat turned backwards
Back when it was comedic relief to say "faggot"
Faggot, faggot, faggot, we ain't know no better
Elementary kids with no filter, however
My auntie became a man and I took pride in it
She wasn′t gay, she ate pussy, and that was the difference
That's what I told my friends in second grade
She picking me up from school, they stare at her in the face
They couldn't comprehend what I grew accustomed
We pull off bumpin′ quick like it was nothing

My auntie is a man now, what a relationship
I grew up fast, I needed no one to babysit
He gave me some cash, then gave me some gang
Cherry freshener on the dash, I never complained
She even cut my hair at the pad, was loving my fade
The first person I seen write a rap, that′s when my life had changed

House full of demo, smoke stuck on the window
Cameras on the microphone, all women and men though
My auntie was a man now, we cool with it
The history had trickled down and made us ig'nant
My favorite cousin said he′s returning the favor
And following my auntie with the same behavior

Demetrius is Mary-Ann now
He's more confident to live his plan now
But the family in disbelief this time
Convincing themselves, "He ain′t living discreet, he's fine"
They said they never seen it in him, but I seen it
The Barbie dolls played off the reflection of Venus

He built a wall so tall you couldn′t climb over
He didn't laugh as hard when the kids start jokin'
"Faggot, faggot, faggot," we ain′t know no better
Middle school kids with no filter, however
I had to be very mindful of my good cousin
I knew exactly who he was, but I still loved him

Demetrius is Mary-Ann now
I mean he′s really Mary-Ann, even took things further
Changed his gender, before Bruce Jenner was certain
Living his truth, even if it meant see a surgeon
We didn't talk for a while, he seemed more distant
Wasn′t comfortable around me, everything was offensive
But I recall we both had a sick sense of humor
Made raw, but time changes all

Demetrius is Mary-Ann now
Remember church, Easter Sunday?
I sat in the pew, you had stronger faith
More spiritual when these dudes were livin' life straight
Which I found ironic ′cause the pastor didn't see him the same
He said my cousin was goin′ through some things
He promised the world we livin' in was an act on abomination and Demetrius was to blame
I knew you was conflicted by the feelings a preacher made
Wonderin' if God still call you a decent man
Still, you found the courage to be subservient just to anoint
Until he singled you out to prove his point, sayin′

"Demetrius is Mary-Ann now"
Church, his auntie is a man now, it hurt
He the most ′cause his belief was close to his words
Forcing me to stand now
I said, "Mr. Preacher man, should we love thy neighbor?"
"The laws of the land or the heart, what's greater?"
"I recognize the study she was taught since birth"
"But that don′t justify the feelings that my cousin preserved"

The building was thinking out loud, bad angel
That's when you looked at me and smiled, said, "Thank you"
The day I chose humanity over religion
The family got closer, it was all forgiven
I said them F-bombs, I ain′t know any better
Mistakenly, I didn't think you′d know any different
See, I was taught words was nothing more than a sound
If everything was pronounced without any intentions

If every second, you challenge the shit I was kicking
Reminded me about a show I did out the city
That time I brung a fan on stage to rap
But disapproved the word that she couldn't say with me
You said, "Kendrick, ain't no room for contradiction"
"To truly understand love, switch position"
"Faggot, faggot, faggot," we can say it together
But only if you let a white girl say, "Nigga"
It was one of the worst performances I′ve seen in my life
I couldn't sleep last night because I felt this sh-
Ooh, ah, ooh, ahOoh, ah, ah, ooh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yee!

Enoch, your father′s just detoxed, my callin' is right on time
Transformation, I must have a thousand lives
And like three thousand wives
You should know that I'm slightly off writin′ off demons that been outside
Better known as myself, I′m a demigod
Every thought is creative, sometimes I'm afraid of my open mind

On my mind and it′s heavy
Tear you in pieces 'cause it′s way too heavy
My diamonds, the choker is heavy
More life to give on demand, are you ready?
Who keep 'em honest like us?
Who in alignment like us?
Who gotta heal ′em all? Us (us)
When there's no one to call

Don't need no conversation
It ain′t about the business, shut the door now
It′s a celebration
And if this sh- ain't bussin′, what's it for now?

Steppin′ out when the weight lifts
Floatin' on ′em (ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)
Floatin' on 'em (float, float, ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)
Floatin′ on ′em (float, float, ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)
Floatin' on ′em (float, ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)
Steppin' out when the weight lifts
Floatin′ on 'em (ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)
Floatin′ on 'em (float, float, ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)
Floatin' on ′em (float, float, ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)
Floatin′ on 'em (float, float, ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)

Uzi, your father′s in deep meditation
My spirit's awaken, my brain is asleep
I got a new temperature
Sharpenin′ multiple swords in the faith I believe
I think about Robert Kelly
If he weren't molested, I wonder if life′ll fail him
I wonder if Oprah found closure
The way that she postered the hurt that a women carries

My mother abused young
Like all of them others back were we from
SSI bury family members
At the repass, they servin' Popeyes chicken
What you know about Black trauma?
F&Ns, kickin' back is another genre
Tyler Perry, the face of a thousand rappers
Using violence to cover what really happen

I know somebody′s listenin′
Past life regressions to know my conditions
It's based of experience
Comma for comma, my habits insensitive
Watchin′ my cousin struggle with addiction
Then watchin' her firstborn make a million
And both of them off the grid for forgiveness
I′m sacrificin' myself to start the healin′ and

On my mind and it's heavy
Tear you in pieces 'cause it′s way too heavy
My diamonds, the choker is heavy
More life to give on demand, are you ready
Who keep ′em honest like us?
Who in alignment like us?
Who gotta heal 'em all? Us (us)
When there′s no one to call us (us)

Say, "Hydrate, it's time to heal"
Safe, you′re frustrated, I can feel
Huddle up, tie the flag, call the troops, holler back
Huddle up, tie the flag
Call the troops, holler back (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

People get taken over by this pain-body
Because this energy field that almost has a life of its own
It needs to, periodically, feed on more unhappiness

We do not have the lyrics for Kendrick Lamar x Cashmere Cat Mirror Vibe yet.
As I get a little older, I realize life is perspective
And my perspective may differ from yours
I wanna say thank you to everyone that′s been down with meAll my fans, all my beautiful fans
Anyone who's ever gave me a listen, all my people

I come from a generation of pain, where murder is minor
Rebellious and Margielas′ll chip you for designer
Belt buckles and clout, overzealous if prone to violence
Make the wrong turn, be a will of the wheel alignment

Residue burned, missed at a inner-city
Miscommunication to keep homi' detective busy
No protection is risky
Desensitized, I vandalized pain
Covered up and camouflaged
Get used to hearin' arsenal rain

Analyze, risk your life, take the charge
Homies done fucked your baby mama once you hit the yard, that′s culture
Twenty-three hour lockdown, then somebody called
Said your lil′ nephew was shot down, the culture's involved

I done seen niggas do seventeen, hit the halfway house
Get out and get his brains blown out, lookin′ to buy some weed
Car wash is played out, new GoFundMe accounts'll proceed
A brand-new victim′ll shatter those dreams, the culture

(I want, I want, I want, I want)
But I want you to want me too (I want, I want, I want, I want)
I want the hood to want me back (I want, I want, I want, I want)
I want the hood
Look what I done for you (look what I done for you)
Look what I done for you

I said I do this for my culture
To let y'all know what a nigga look like in a bulletproof Rover
In my mama′s sofa was a doo-doo popper
Head tricker, walk up closer
Ain't no Photoshoppin'

Friends bipolar, grab you by your pockets
No option if you froze up, always play the offense
Niggas goin′ to work and sellin′ work, late for work
Workin' late, prayin′ for work, but he on paperwork
That's the culture, point the finger, promote ya
Remote location, witness protection, they gon′ hold ya

The streets got me fucked up, y'all can miss me
I wanna represent for us
New revolution was up and movin′
I'm in Argentina wiping my tears full of confusion
Water in between us, another peer's been executed
History repeats again
Make amends, then find a nigga with the same skin to do it

But that′s the culture, crack a bottle
Hard to deal with the pain when you′re sober
By tomorrow, we forget the remains, we start over
That's the problem
Our foundation was trained to accept whatever follows
Dehumanize, insensitive
Scrutinize the way we live for you and I

Enemies shook my hand, I can promise I′ll meet you
In a land where no equal is your equal
Never say I ain't told ya, nah
In the land where hurt people hurt more people
Fuck callin′ it culture

(I want, I want, I want, I want)
But I want you to want me too (I want, I want, I want, I want)
I want the hood to want me back (I want, I want, I want, I want)
I want the hood
Look what I done for you (look what I done for you)
Look what I done for you

Take the drums out

Celebrate new life when it come back around
The purpose is in the lessons we learnin' now
Sacrifice personal gain over everything
Just to see the next generation better than ours
I wasn′t perfect, the skin I was in had truly suffered

Temptation and patience, everything that the body nurtures
I felt the good, I felt the bad, and I felt the worry
But all-in-all, my productivity had stayed urgent
Face your fears, always knew that I would make it here
Where the energy is magnified and persevered

Consciousness is synchronized and crystal clear
Euphoria is glorified and made His
Reflectin' on my life and what I done
Paid dues, made rules, change outta love
Them same views made schools change curriculums
But didn't change me starin′ down the barrel of that gun

Should I feel resentful I didn′t see my full potential?
Should I feel regret about the good that I was into?
Everything is everything, this ain't coincidental
I woke up that morning with more heart to give you
As I bleed through the speakers, feel my presence

To my brother, to my kids, I′m in Heaven
To my mother, to my sis, I'm in Heaven
To my father, to my wife, I am serious, this is Heaven
To my friends, make sure you countin′ them blessings
To my fans, make sure you make them investments

And to the killer that sped up my demise
I forgive you, just know your soul's in question
I seen the pain in your pupil when that trigger had squeezed
And though you did me gruesome, I was surely relieved
I completed my mission, wasn′t ready to leave
But fulfilled my days, my Creator was pleased

I can't stress how I love y'all
I don′t need to be in flesh just to hug y′all
The memories recollect just because y'all
Celebrate me with respect
The unity we protect is above all

And Sam, I′ll be watchin' over you
Make sure my kids watch all my interviews
Make sure you live all the dreams we produce
Keep that genius in your brain on the move
And to my neighborhood, let the good prevail
Make sure them babies and the leaders outta jail

Look for salvation when troubles get real
′Cause you can't help the world until you help yourself
And I can′t blame the hood the day that I was killed
Y'all had to see it, that's the only way to feel
And though my physical won′t reap the benefits
The energy that carry on emits still

I want you
Wait
King of my city, king of my country, king of my homeland
King of the filthy, king of the fallen, we living again
King of the shooters, looters, boosters, and ghettos poppin'
King of the past, present, future, my ancestors watchin'
King of the culture, king of the soldiers, king of the bloodshed
King of the wisdom, king of the ocean, king of the respect
King of the optimistics and dreamers that go and get it
King of the winners, district, and geniuses with conviction
King of the fighters, king of the fathers, king of the belated
King of the answer, king of the problem, king of the forsaken
King of the empathy, you resent me, king of remorse
King of my enemies, may they father feed, I rejoice
King of the skyscrapers, dodging haters, broke religion
Nine faces, go against 'em, I erased 'em with precision
I embrace them with collision
Kings did it, king vision, Black Panther, King Kendrick
All hail the king, I dropped a million tears
I know several responsibilities put me here
I don't pedal backwards but I live old-fashioned
And the lens that I'm looking through
Won't prescribe me the right glasses, masses are now free
Ashes I'm dumpin' out, 'bout to spread 'cross all seas
Sisters and brother in unison, not because of me
Because we don't glue with the opposition, we glue with peace
And I'm still gon' fuck up your organization if any beef
What do you stand for?
Are you an activist? What are your city plans for?
Are you an accident? Are you just in the way?
Your native tongue contradictin' what your body language say
Are you a king or you jokin'? Are you a king or you posin'?
Are you a king or you smokin' bud rocks to keep you open?
Because the king don't cry, king don't die
King don't lie, king give heart, king get by, king don't fall
Kingdom come, when I come, you know why
King, king, king, king, I am T'Challa!
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
I get a feeling on you
I get a feeling on you
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer,
all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer,
all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer
Tell me what you gon' do to me
Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword
Bring a morgue, but you can't bring the truth to me
Fuck you and all your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize you far as confidence and
Calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
Oh, you important?
You the moral to the story, you endorsing?
Motherfucker, I don't even like you
Corrupted man's heart with a gift
That's how you find out who you dealin' with
A small percentage who I'm building with
I want the credit if I'm losing or I'm winning
On my momma that's the realest shit
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
I get a feeling on you
I get a feeling on you
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer,
all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer,
all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer
Skin covered with an ego
Get to talking like a end-forth, like a rebound
No control, no off switch in the way that you bringing me down
It's a turn on, get it away from me
Know you mean wrong, keep away from me
And it's all wrong, get it away from me, yeah
I just cry for no reason, I just pray for no reason
I just thank for the life, for the day
For the hours and another life breathin'
How did it all go to feel good?
You could live it all if you feel bad
Better live your life
We were running out of time
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
I get a feeling on you
I get a feeling on you
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer,
all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer,
all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer



Everybody put three fingers in the air
The sky is falling, the wind is calling
Stand for something or die in the morning
Section 80, HiiiPoWeR
Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
Malcolm X put a hex on my future, someone catch me
I'm falling victim to a revolutionary song
The Serengeti's clone
Back to put you backstabbers back on your spinal bone
You slipped your disc when I slid you my disc
You wanted to diss, but jumped on my dick
Grown men never should bite their tongue
unless you eating pussy that smell like it's a stale plum
I got my finger on the motherfucking pistol
aiming it at a pig, Charlotte's Web is gonna miss you
My issue isn't televised, and you ain't gotta tell the wise
how to stay on beat, because our life's an instrumental
This is physical and mental, I won't sugar-coat it
You'd die from diabetes if these other niggas wrote it
And everything on TV just a figment of imagination
I don't want no plastic nation, +dread+ that like a Haitian
While you motherfuckers waiting, I be off the slave ship
Building pyramids, writing my own hieroglyphs
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Nigga, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought bitches
I mean the shit is, Huey Newton going stupid
You can't resist his, HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR
Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
If I see it how he seen it, that would make my parents happy
Sorry mama, I can't turn the other cheek
They wanna knock me off the edge like a fucking widow's peak, uhh
And she always told me pray for the weak, uhh
Them demons got me, I ain't prayed in some weeks, uhh
Dear Lord come save me, the Devil's working hard
He probably clocking double shifts on all of his jobs
Frightening, so fucking frightening
Enough to drive a man insane, I need a license
to kill, I'm standing on a field full of land mines
Doing the moonwalk, hoping I blow up in time
Cause 2012 might not be a fucking legend
Trying to be a fucking legend, the man of mankind
Who said a black man in the Illuminati?
Last time I checked that was the biggest racist party
So get up off that slave ship
Build your own pyramids, write your own hieroglyphs
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Nigga, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought bitches
I mean the shit is, Bobby Seale making meals
You can't resist his, HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR

We been down for too long

Who said a black man in Illuminati?
Last time I checked that was the biggest racist party
Last time I checked, we was racing with Marcus Garvey
on the freeway to Africa till I wreck my Audi
And I want everybody to view my autopsy
So you can see exactly where the government had shot me
No conspiracy, my fate is inevitable
They play musical chairs once I'm on that pedestal
Frightening, so fucking frightening
Enough to drive a man insane, a woman insane
The reason Lauryn Hill don't sing, or Kurt Cobain
loaded that clip and then said 'Bang!', the drama it bring
is crazy, product of the late 80s
Trying to stay above water, that's why we shun the Navy
Pull your guns and play me, let's set it off
Cause a riot, throw a Molotov
Somebody told me them pirates had got lost
cause we been off them slave ships
Got our own pyramids, write our own hieroglyphs
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR

I fight pain and hurricanes, today I wept
I'm tryna fight back tears, flood on my doorsteps
Life a livin' hell, puddles of blood in the streets
Shooters on top of the building, government aiding relief

Who need a hero? (hero)
You need a hero, look in the mirror, there go your hero
Who on the front lines at Ground Zero? (hero)
My heart don't skip a beat, even when hard times bumps the needle

Clutchin' on deaf ears again, rapture is comin'
It's all prophecy and if I gotta be sacrificed
for the greater good, then that's what it gotta be
Who gon' pray for me?
Take my pain for me?
Save my soul for me?

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm always ready for a war again
Go down that road again
It's all the same
I'm always ready to take a life again
You know I'll ride again
It's all the same (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Tell me who's gon' save me from myself
When this life is all I know
Tell me who's gon' save me from this hell
Without you, I'm all alone
Who gon' pray for me?
Take my pain for me?
Save my soul for me?
'Cause I'm alone, you see
If I'm gon' die for you
If I'm gon' kill for you
Then I'll spill this blood for you, hey
I fight the world, I fight you, I fight myself
I fight God, just tell me how many burdens left
I fight pain and hurricanes, today I wept
I'm tryna fight back tears, flood on my doorsteps
Life a livin' hell, puddles of blood in the streets
Shooters on top of the building, government aiding relief
Earthquake, the body drop, the ground breaks
The poor one with smoke lungs and Scarface
Who need a hero? (hero)
You need a hero, look in the mirror, there go your hero
Who on the front lines at Ground Zero? (hero)
My heart don't skip a beat, even when hard times bumps the needle
Mass destruction and mass corruption
Their souls are sufferin' men
Clutchin' on deaf ears again, rapture is comin'
It's all prophecy and if I gotta be sacrificed
for the greater good, then that's what it gotta be
Who gon' pray for me?
Take my pain for me?
Save my soul for me?
'Cause I'm alone, you see
If I'm gon' die for you
If I'm gon' kill for you
Then I'll spill this blood for you, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Who gon' pray for me?
Take my pain for me?
Save my soul for me?
'Cause I'm alone, you see
If I'm gon' die for you
If I'm gon' kill for you
Then I'll spill this blood for you, hey
Just in case my finger roll
I live by my own, no
I live by my own, no
I live by my own
Just in case my finger roll
I live by my own, no
I live by my own, no
I live by my own
It was always me vs the world
Until I found it's me vs me
Why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why, why?
Just remember, what happens on Earth stays on Earth!
We gon' put it in reverse
Darling, I told you many times
And I am telling you once again
Just to remind you, sweetheart
That my—
Oh Lamar, Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard
Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark
Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star
Life is one funny mothafucka
A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him
I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep
Introverted by my thoughts
Children, listen, it gets deep
See, once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects
The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect
Adaptation inevitable: gun violence, crack spot
Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
Anthony was the oldest of seven
Well-respected, calm and collected
Laughin' and jokin' made life easier
Hard times, Momma on crack
A four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her
His family history: pimpin' and bangin'
He was meant to be dangerous
Clocked him a grip and start slangin'
Fifteen, scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces
Even got some head from a smoker last weekend
Dodged a policeman, workin' for his big homie
Small-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him
10,000 dollars out of a project housing, that's on the daily
Seen his first mil twenty years old, had a couple of babies
Had a couple of shooters
Caught a murder case, fingerprints on the gun they assumin'
But witnesses couldn't prove it
That was back when he turned his back
And they killed his cousin
He beat the case and went back to hustlin'
Bird-shufflin', Anthony rang
The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang
That 5.0 thing, they say 5-0 came
Circlin' parking lots and parking spots
And hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks
Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it
He brushed them off
And walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken
See, at this chicken spot
There was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot
With a curly top and a gap in his teeth
He worked the window, his name was Ducky
He came from the streets, the Robert Taylor Homes
Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome
Drove to California with a woman on him and 500 dollars
They had a son, hopin' that he'd see college
Hustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it
Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends
Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
'Cross the street from the projects
Anthony planned to rob it
Stuck up the place before, back in '84
That's when affiliation was really eight gears of war
So many relatives tellin' us, sellin' us devilish works
Killin' us, crime, intelligent, felonious
Prevalent proposition with 9's
Ducky was well-aware
They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
He figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides
Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line
Two extra biscuits, Anthony liked him
And then let him slide; they didn't kill him
In fact, it look like they're the last to survive
Pay attention, that one decision changed both of they lives
One curse at a time
Reverse the manifest and good karma, and I'll tell you why
You take two strangers, and put 'em in random predicaments; give 'em a soul
So they can make their own choices and live with it
Twenty years later, them same strangers you make 'em meet again
Inside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits
Then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident
Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?
Because if Anthony killed Ducky
Top Dawg could be servin' life
While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight
So, I was takin' a walk the other day…
This what God feel like, huh, yeah
Laughin' to the bank like, "A-ha!", huh, yeah
Flex on swole like, "A-ha!", huh, yeah
You feel some type of way, then a-ha!
Huh, yeah (a-ha-ha, a-ha-ha)
Ever since a young man
All I wanted to be was a gunman
Shootin’ up the charts, better run, man
Y'all gotta see that I won, man
Slick as El DeBarge with the finger waves, work it, JT
Handle bars like a fade, watch me work it, JT
I'm at large, runnin’ plays like a circuit, JT
I'm sellin' verses, Jay Z, watch me work it, JT
Look, look… hol' up!
Don't judge me, my mama caught me with a strap
Don't judge me, I was young, fuckin' all the rats
Don't judge me, aimin’ at your head for a stack
Don’t judge me! Don't judge me!
Now my home got a Valley peak
Don’t judge me, if I press your line you a freak
Don't judge me, won't you tell a friend y'all gon’ see—
This what God feel like, huh, yeah
Laughin' to the bank like, "A-ha!", huh, yeah
Flex on swole like, "A-ha!", huh, yeah
You feel some type of way, then a-ha!
Huh, yeah (a-ha-ha, a-ha-ha)
Fuck is you talkin' to?
Aye, do you know who you talkin' to?
Slide on you like fallen drapes
God toss full of carnivals
I kill 'em with kindness
Or I kill 'em with diamonds
Or I put up like fifteen hundred
Get yo' ass killed by the finest
Everything in life is a gamble
Nothin' in life I can't handle
Seen it all, done it all, felt pain more
For the cars, I done put blood on sword
Everything I do is to embrace y'all
Everything I write is a damn eight ball
Everything I touch is a damn gold mine
Everything I say is from an angel
I don't rush shit, fuck shit
Always your shit, my shit
Cannonballs to ignite shit
Morning to the night shift
I'm on, I ain't sorry for it
Ask for a piece of mine, you charged me for it
I wanna see sometimes if you ignore it
I'm in the streets sometimes and can't afford it
I got a bad habit
Levitate, duckin' haters
Oh my! My heart is rich, my heart is famous
This what God feel like
Huh, yeah (this what God feel like)
Laughin' to the bank like, "A-ha!"
(This what God feel like)
Huh, yeah (this what God feel like)
Flex on swole like, "A-ha!"
(This what God feel like)
Huh, yeah (this what God feel like)
You feel some type of way, then a-ha!
(This what God feel like)
Huh, yeah (this what God feel like)
This what God feel like
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth
What’s up, family? Yeah, it's yo cousin Carl, man, just givin' you a call, man. I know you been havin’ a lot on yo mind lately, and I know you feel like, you know, people ain't been prayin' for you. But you have to understand this, man, that we are a cursed people. Deuteronomy 28:28 says, "The Lord shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and astonishment of heart." See, family, that's why you feel like you feel like you got a chip on your shoulder. Until you finally get the memo, you will always feel that way…
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Pain in my heart carry burdens full of struggle
Why God, why God do I gotta bleed?
Every stone thrown at you restin' at my feet
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Earth is no more, won't you burn this muh'fucka?
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth
I beat yo ass, keep talkin’ back
I beat yo ass, who bought you that?
You stole it, I beat yo ass if you say that game is broken
I beat yo ass if you jump on my couch
I beat yo ass if you walk in this house
With tears in your eyes, runnin’ from Poo Poo and Prentice
Go back outside, I beat yo ass, lil nigga
That homework better be finished, I beat yo ass
Your teachers better not be bitchin' ’bout you in class
That pizza better not be wasted, you eat it all
That TV better not be loud if you got it on
Them Jordans better not get dirty when I just bought 'em
Better not hear 'bout you humpin' on Keisha’s daughter
Better not hear you got caught up
I beat yo ass, you better not run to your father
I beat yo ass, you know my patience runnin' thin
I got beaucoup payments to make
County building's on my ass
Tryna take my food stamps away
I beat yo ass if you tell them social workers he live here
I beat yo ass if I beat yo ass twice and you still here
Seven years old, think you run this house by yourself?
Nigga, you gon' fear me if you don't fear no one else
If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucka up
And then I'd take two puffs
I'm high now, I'm high now
I'm high now, I'm high now
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth
I'll prolly die anonymous
I'll prolly die with promises
I'll prolly die walkin' back home from the candy house
I'll prolly die because these colors are standin' out
I'll prolly die because I ain't know Demarcus was snitchin'
I'll prolly die at these house parties, fuckin' with bitches
I'll prolly die from witnesses leavin' me falsed accused
I'll prolly die from thinkin' that me and your hood was cool
Or maybe die from pressin' the line, actin' too extra
Or maybe die because these smokers
Are more than desperate
I'll prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges
Body slammed on black and white paint, my bones snappin'
Or maybe die from panic or die from bein' too lax
Or die from waitin' on it, die 'cause I'm movin' too fast
I'll prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments
I'll prolly die tryna diffuse two homies arguin'
I'll prolly die 'cause that's what you do when you're 17
All worries in a hurry, I wish I controlled things
If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucka up
And then I'd take two puffs
I've been hungry all my life
I'm high now, I'm high now
I'm high now, I'm high now
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
Now…
When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the bad girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out
And just kill somethin', drill somethin'
Get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say 'bout me reveal
If my reputation would miss me
What they see from me
Would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me
Would make 'em highlight my simplest lines
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me
So hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me
So hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
Damn
Goddamn you
Goddamn me
Goddamn us
Goddamn we
Goddamn us all
Verse two says you only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities. So until we come back to these commandments, until you come back to these commandments, we're gonna feel this way, we're gonna be under this curse. Because he said he's gonna punish us, the so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians, are the true children of Israel. We are the Israelites according to the Bible. The children of Israel, he's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience, because we chose to follow other gods that aren't his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee. So, just like you chasten your own son, he's gonna chastise you because he loves you. So that's why we get chastised, that's why we're in the position we're in. Until we come back to these laws, statutes and commandments, and do what the Lord said, these curses are gonna be upon us. We're gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live here in today, in the United States of America. I love you, son, and I pray for you. God bless you, shalom.
America, God bless you if it's good to you
America please take my hand
Can you help me underst-
New Kung Fu Kenny
Throw a steak off the yacht
To a pool full of sharks, he'll take it
Leave him in the wilderness
With a sworn nemesis, he'll make it
Take the gratitude from him
I bet he'll show you something, woah
I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothing
I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothing
I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothing
I'll chip a nigga then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like bitch I did that x-rated
Johnny don't wanna go to school no more, no more
Johnny said books ain't cool no more (no more)
Johnny wanna be a rapper like his big cousin
Johnny caught a body yesterday out hustlin'
God bless America you know we all love him
Yesterday I got a call like from my dog like 101
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
Talkin' out his head philosphing on what the lord had done
He said, "K-Dot can you pray for me?
It's been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome"
He was lookin' for some closure
Hopin' I could bring him closer
To the spiritual, my spirit do no better, but I told him
"I can't sugar coat the answer for you
This is how I feel—if somebody kill my son
That mean somebody's gettin' killed"
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch
I wait in front a niggas spot and watch him hit his block
I'll catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all I got
I'll chip a nigga then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, "Bitch I did that"
Ain't no black power when your baby killed by a coward
I can't even keep the peace, don't you fuck with one of ours
It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird on the street, paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my momma
Touch my sister, touch my woman
Touch my daddy, touch my niece
Touch my nephew, touch my brother
You should chip a nigga then throw the blower in his lap
Matter fact, I'm 'bout to speak at this convention
Call you back
Alright kids we're gonna talk about gun control
(Pray for me)
Damn
It's not a place
This country is to be a sound of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look around
Hail Mary, Jesus and Joseph
The great American flag
Is wrapped and dragged with explosives
Compulsive disorder, sons and daughters
Barricaded blocks and borders
Look what you taught us
It's murder on my street, w'all street, back streets
Wall street, corporate offices, banks
Employees and bosses with homicidal thoughts
Donald Trump's in office, we lost Barack
And promised to never doubt him again
But is America honest or do we bask in sin?
Pass the gin, I mix it with American blood
Then bash him in, you crippin'ìg or you married to blood?
I'll ask again—oops—accident
It's nasty when you set us up
Then roll the dice, then bet us up
You overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us
Gang members or terrorists, et cetera, et cetera
Americas reflections of me
That's what a mirror does
It's not a place
This country is to be a sound of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look ar-
Damn
Love or lust
Damn
All of us

I need some water
Somethin' came over me
Way too hot to simmer down
Might as well overheat
Too close to comfort
As blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racin' like a junkie's
I just need you to want me
Am I askin' too much?
Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that
Girl, I respect the cat
I promise just a touch
Let me put the head in
If it's okay
She said, "It's okay."
Yeah, I need everybody's motherfuckin' hands up right now
I need everybody's motherfuckin'—
Door and his Nike Air Rattles
Rush the fire exit, no time for battles
Well I, I never expected
This that new shit
This that new, new shit
Wake up in the mornin'
Thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch
Don't go to work today, cop you a fit
Or maybe some kicks and make you—
Door in his Nike Air Rattles
Rush the fire exit, no time for battles
Well I, I never expected
Wake up in the mornin'
Thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy— hol' up!
Wake up in the mornin'
Thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch, don't go to work today
Cop you a fit or maybe some kicks and make it work today
Hang with your homies, stunt on your baby mama
Sip some lean, go get a pistol, shoot out the window
Bet your favorite team, play you some Madden
Go to the club or your mama house
Whatever you doin', just make it count
(I need some water)
Wake up in the mornin'
Thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Hop in the shower, put on your makeup, lace your weave up
Touch on yourself, call up your nigga, tell him he ain't shit
Credit card scam, get you a Visa, make him pay your rent
Hop on the 'Gram, flex on the bitches that be hatin' on you
Pop you a pill, call up your bitches, have 'em waitin' on you
Go to the club, have you some fun, make that ass bounce
It's whatever, just make it count
I need some water
Somethin' came over me
Way too hot to simmer down
Might as well overheat
Too close to comfort
As blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racin' like a junkie's
I just need you to want me
Am I askin' too much?
Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that
Girl, I respect the cat
I promise just a touch
Let me put the head in
If it's okay
She said, "It's okay."
I wake in the mornin', my head spinnin' from the last night
Both in the trance, feelings I did—what a fast life!
Manager called, the lobby called, it's 11:30
Did this before, promised myself I'd be a hour early
Room full of clothes, bag full of money: call it loose change
Fumbled my jewelry, 100k, I lost a new chain
Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M
Take me a nap and do it again
We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news
Lookin' for confirmation, hopin' election wasn't true
All of us worried, all of us buried, and our feeling's deep
None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap
Still and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it
Bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly
Time passin', things change
Revertin' back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways; Lust
Lately, I feel like I been lustin' over the fame
Lately, we lust on the same routine of shame
Lately, lately, lately, my lust been hidin' (Lately)
Lately, it’s all contradiction
Lately, I’m not here
Lately, I lust over self
Lust turn into fear
Lately, in James 4:4 says
Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord
Brace yourself, lust is all yours
I need some water
Somethin' came over me
Way too high to simmer down
Might as well overheat
Too close to comfort
As blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racin' like a junkie's
I just need you to want me
Am I askin' too much?
Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that
Girl, I respect the cat
I promise just a touch
Let me put the head in
If it's okay
She said, "It's okay."
Wicked or weakness
You gotta see this
Waaaaay (yeah, yeah!)
Nobody pray for me
If you're not there for me
Waaaaay (yeah, yeah!)
Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits
But now I’m countin' this
Parmesan where my accountant lives
In fact, I'm downin’ this
D'USSÉ with my boo bae, tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy yo' ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
A.M. to the P.M., P.M. to the A.M., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know, bitch, be humble
(Hol’ up, bitch) sit down
(Hol’ up lil' bitch, hol’ up lil' bitch) be humble
(Hol' up, bitch) sit down
(Sit down, hol' up, lil’ bitch)
Be humble (bitch)

Who dat nigga thinkin' that he frontin' on Man-Man? (Man-Man)
Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman)
Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
I make a play fuckin' up your whole life
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still will take you down right on your mama's couch in Polo socks, ayy
This shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy
I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy
I don't fabricate it, ayy, most of y'all be fakin', ayy
I stay modest 'bout it, ayy, she elaborate it, ayy
This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ayy
Watch my soul speak, you let the meds talk, ayy
If I kill a nigga, it won't be the alcohol, ayy
I'm the realest nigga after all, bitch, be humble
(Hol' up, bitch) sit down
(Hol' up lil' bitch, hol' up lil' bitch) be humble

Love's gonna get you killed
But pride’s gonna be the death of you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me and—
It wasn't all to share, but there
In another life, I surely was there
It wasn't all to share, but there
I care, I care
Hell-raising, wheel-chasing, new worldy possessions
Flesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen?
The better part, the human heart
You love ’em or dissect 'em
Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
See, in the perfect world, I would be perfect, world
I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world
I don't love people enough to put my faith in men
I put my faith in these lyrics, hoping I make amend
I understand I ain't perfect
I probably won't come around
This time, I might put you down
Last time, I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now
My feelings might go numb, you're dealing with cold thumb
I’m willing to give up a leg and arm and show empathy from
Pity parties and functions and you and yours
A perfect world, you probably live another 24
I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
It wasn't all to share, but there
In another life, I surely was there
It wasn't all to share, but there
I care, I care
Maybe I wasn’t there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Now, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive
Cold as December, but never remember what Winter did
I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays
Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior of you and I
See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches
I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison
I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world
It wasn't all to share, but there
In another life, I surely was there
It wasn't all to share, but there
I care, I care
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (fired, fire)
All I want tonight just get high up (high, high, high)
Girl, you look so good, it's to die for (die for)
Ooh that pussy good, it's to die for (on fire)
It's a secret society
All we ask is trust
(All we ask is trust)
All we got is us
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Kung Fu Kenny, now
My resume is real enough for two millenniums
A better way to make a wave's not defendin' them
I meditate and moderate all of my wins again
I'm hangin' on the fence again
I'm always on your mind
I put my lyric and my lifeline on the line
And ain't no limit when I might shine, might grind
You rollin' with it at the right time, right now
(Only for the dollar sign)
Bad gyal RiRi, now
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve, deeper now
On your pulse like a CD in
Gas in the bitch like it's premium
Haul ass on a bitch all in the fast lane
Been a bad bitch way before any cash came
I'm established
Hundred carats on my name, run the atlas
I'm a natural, I'm alright
I'm a savage, I'm an asshole, I'm a king
Shimmy-yeah, shimmy-yeah, shimmy-yeah, rock
You can tell your nigga he can meet me outside (yeah)
You can babysit him when I leave him outside
Ain't no other love like the one I know
I done been down so long I slowed
I done came down so hard I slowed
I don't sleep forever, all a real nigga want
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (fired, fire)
All I want is tonight is just to get high up (yeah)
(all I want is, all I want is)
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
10-4, no switching sides
Feel somethin' wrong
You acting shifty, you don't ride
With me no more, I need
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it money? Is it fame? Is it weed? Is it drink?
Is it comin' down with the loud pipes and the rain?
Big chillin', only for the power in your name
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it love for the streets when the lights get dark?
Is it unconditional when the 'Rari don't start?
Tell me when your loyalty is comin' from the heart
Tell me who you loyal to
Do it start with your women or your man? (Mmm)
Do it end with your family and friends? (Mmm)
Or you're loyal to yourself in advance?
I said, tell me who you loyal to
Is it anybody that you would lie for?
Anybody you would slide for?
Anybody you would die for?
That's what God for
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (fired, fire)
All I want tonight is just to get high up
(All I want is, all I want is)
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
10-4, no switching sides
Feel somethin' wrong
You acting shifty, you don't ride
With me no more, I need
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
It's so hard to be humble
It's so hard to be
Lord knows is I'm trying
Lord knows is I'm dying, baby
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
I feel like a chip on my shoulders
I feel like I'm losin' my focus
I feel like I'm losin' my patience
I feel like my thoughts in the basement
Feel like, I feel like you're miseducated
Feel like I don't wanna be bothered
I feel like you may be the problem
I feel like it ain't no tomorrow, fuck the world
The world is endin', I'm done pretendin'
And fuck you if you get offended
I feel like friends been overrated
I feel like the family been fakin'
I feel like the feelings are changin'
Feel like my daughter compromised and jaded
Feel like you wanna scrutinize how I made it
Feel like I ain't feelin' you all
Feel like removin' myself, no feelings involved
I feel for you, I've been in the field for you
It's real for you, right? Shit, I feel like—
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin'
I feel niggas been out of pocket
I feel niggas tappin' they pockets
I feel like debating on who the greatest can stop it
I am legend, I feel like all of y'all is peasants
I feel like all of y'all is desperate
I feel like all it take is a second to feel like
Mike Jordan whenever holdin' a real mic
I ain't feelin' your presence
Feel like I'ma learn you a lesson
Feel like only me and the music, though
I feel like your feelin' ain't mutual
I feel like the enemy you should know
Feel like the feelin' of no hope
The feelin' of bad dope
A quarter ounce manipulated from soap
The feelin', the feelin' of false freedom
I'll force-feed 'em the poison that fill 'em up in the prison
I feel like it's just me
Look, I feel like I can't breathe
Look, I feel like I can't sleep
Look, I feel heartless, often off this
Feelin' of fallin', of fallin' apart with
Darkest hours, lost it
Fillin' the void of bein' employed with ballin'
Streets is talkin', fill in the blanks with coffins
Fill up the banks with dollars
Fill up the graves with fathers
Fill up the babies with bullshit
Internet blogs and pulpit, fill 'em with gossip
I feel like this gotta be the feelin' what 'Pac was
The feelin' of an apocalypse happenin'
But nothin' is awkward, the feelin' won't prosper
The feelin' is toxic, I feel like I'm boxin' demons
Monsters, false prophets schemin'
Sponsors, industry promises
Niggas, bitches, honkies, crackers, Compton
Church, religion, token blacks, and bondage
Lawsuit visits, subpoena served in concert
Fuck your feelings, I mean this for imposters
I can feel it, the phoenix sure to watch us
I can feel it, the dream is more than process
I can put a regime that forms a Loch Ness
I can feel it, the scream that haunts our logic
I feel like say somethin', I feel like take somethin'
I feel like skatin' off, I feel like waitin' for 'em
Maybe it's too late for 'em
I feel like the whole world want me to pray for 'em
But who the fuck prayin' for me?
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Who prayin' for me?
Ain't nobody prayin'
New Kung Fu Kenny
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Y'all know, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
Here we go!
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a, I don't give a, I don't give a fuck
I'm willin' to die for this shit
I done cried for this shit, might take a life for this shit
Put the Bible down and go eye for an eye for this shit
D.O.T. my enemy, won't catch a vibe for this shit, ayy
I been stomped out in front of my mama
My daddy commissary made it to commas
Bitch, all my grandmas dead
So ain't nobody prayin' for me, I'm on your head, ayy
Thirty millions later, know the feds watchin'
Auntie on my telegram, like, "Be cautious!"
I be hangin' out at Tam's, I be on Stockton
I don't do it for the 'Gram, I do it for Compton
I'm willin' to die for this shit, nigga
I'll take your fuckin' life for this shit, nigga
We ain't goin' back to broke, family sellin' dope
That's why you maney-ass rap niggas better know
If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element
I'm allergic to a bitch nigga, ayy
An imaginary rich nigga, ayy
Seven figures, hoe, that slimmer than my bitch figure, ayy
Goin' digital and physical on all y'all, ayy
Bunch of criminals and money in my phone calls, ayy
We okay, we let the A1 fly
Relocate, jump on the same G5
Checkin' for me heavy 'cause I go yeah, I go yeah
They never been ready—yeah, I know yeah, know yeah
100K spread across the floor, 'cross the floor, yeah
None of y'all fuckin' with the flow yeah, the flow yeah
Years in the makin', and don't y'all mistake it
I got 'em by a landslide, we talkin' about races
You know this'll never be a tie, just look at their laces
You know careers take off, just gotta be patient
Mr. One through Five, that's the only logic
Fake my death, go to Cuba, that's the only option
If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element
Damned if I do, if I don't (yuhhh)
Goddamn us all if you won't (yuhhh)
Damn, damn, damn, it's a goddamn shame
You ain't frontline, get out the goddamn way
Niggas thought they wasn't gonna see me, huh?
Niggas thought that K-Dot real life
Was the same life they see on TV, huh?
Niggas wanna flex on me and be in L.A. for free, huh?
Next time they hit the 10 freeway, we need receipt, huh?
'Cause most of y'all ain't real
Most of y'all gon' squeal
Most of y'all just envy, but jealousy get you killed
Most of y'all throw rocks and try to hide your hand
Just say his name and I promise that you'll see Candyman
Because it's all in your eyes, most of y'all tell lies
Most of y'all don't fade, most of y'all been advised
Last LP I tried to lift the black artists
But it's a difference between black artists and wack artists
[Outro: Kendrick Lamar & Kid Capri]
If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
It's the one and only, the world's greatest, the Kid Capri
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element
New shit, new Kung Fu Kenny
I got so many theories and suspicions
I'm diagnosed with real nigga conditions
Today is the day I follow my intuition
Keep the family close—get money, fuck bitches
I double parked the Aston in the red
My mama told me that I'ma work myself to death
My girl told me don't let these hoes get in my head
My world been ecstatic, I checked the signal that read—
Buzzin', radars is buzzin'
Yah, yah, yah, yah
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
Buzzin', radars is buzzin'
Yah, yah, yah, yah
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
Interviews wanna know my thoughts and opinions
Fox News wanna use my name for percentage
My latest muse is my niece, she worth livin'
See me on the TV and scream: "That's Uncle Kendrick!"
Yeah, that's the business
Somebody tell Geraldo this nigga got some ambition
I'm not a politician, I'm not 'bout a religion
I'm a Israelite, don't call me Black no mo'
That word is only a color, it ain't facts no mo'
My cousin called, my cousin Carl Duckworth
Said know my worth
And Deuteronomy say that we all been cursed
I know he walks the Earth
But it's money to get, bitches to hit, yah
Zeroes to flip, temptation is, yah
First on my list, I can't resist, yah
Everyone together now, know that we forever—
Buzzin', radars is buzzin'
Yah, yah, yah, yah
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
Buzzin', radars is buzzin'
Yah, yah, yah, yah
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
I got, I got, I got, I got
Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle though, ambition, flow, inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this
Immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this
Was Yeshua's new weapon
I don’t contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got
Realness, I just kill shit 'cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin’ in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil, that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome, heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve
Yeah, that's him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a—
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you
This is Paula’s oldest son
I know murder, conviction
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids
And I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s DNA
Born inside the beast
My expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn't have nowhere to stay
At 29, I’ve done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I'm supposed to
Antisocial, extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And that’s a riff, gonna plead this case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better, fuck your life
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the makin' of marriages
Tell me somethin'
You mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you're in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy and walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows, I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder—these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder—our DNA
Is it wickedness?
Is it weakness?
You decide
Are we gonna live or die?
So I was takin' a walk the other day, and I seen a woman—a blind woman—pacin' up and down the sidewalk. She seemed to be a bit frustrated, as if she had dropped somethin' and havin' a hard time findin' it. So after watchin' her struggle for a while, I decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know? "Hello, ma'am, can I be of any assistance? It seems to me that you have lost something. I would like to help you find it." She replied: "Oh yes, you have lost something. You've lost your life."
Is it wickedness?
Lamar stated his views on police brutality with that line in the song, quote: "And we hate the popo, wanna kill us in the street fo' sho'…"
Oh please, ugh, I don't like it.
It was always me vs the world
Until I found it's me vs me
Why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why, why?
Just remember, what happens on Earth stays on Earth!
We gon' put it in reverse
Darling, I told you many times
And I am telling you once again
Just to remind you, sweetheart
That my—
Oh Lamar, Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard
Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark
Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star
Life is one funny mothafucka
A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him
I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep
Introverted by my thoughts
Children, listen, it gets deep
See, once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects
The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect
Adaptation inevitable: gun violence, crack spot
Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
Anthony was the oldest of seven
Well-respected, calm and collected
Laughin' and jokin' made life easier
Hard times, Momma on crack
A four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her
His family history: pimpin' and bangin'
He was meant to be dangerous
Clocked him a grip and start slangin'
Fifteen, scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces
Even got some head from a smoker last weekend
Dodged a policeman, workin' for his big homie
Small-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him
10,000 dollars out of a project housing, that's on the daily
Seen his first mil twenty years old, had a couple of babies
Had a couple of shooters
Caught a murder case, fingerprints on the gun they assumin'
But witnesses couldn't prove it
That was back when he turned his back
And they killed his cousin
He beat the case and went back to hustlin'
Bird-shufflin', Anthony rang
The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang
That 5.0 thing, they say 5-0 came
Circlin' parking lots and parking spots
And hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks
Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it
He brushed them off
And walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken
See, at this chicken spot
There was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot
With a curly top and a gap in his teeth
He worked the window, his name was Ducky
He came from the streets, the Robert Taylor Homes
Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome
Drove to California with a woman on him and 500 dollars
They had a son, hopin' that he'd see college
Hustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it
Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends
Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
'Cross the street from the projects
Anthony planned to rob it
Stuck up the place before, back in '84
That's when affiliation was really eight gears of war
So many relatives tellin' us, sellin' us devilish works
Killin' us, crime, intelligent, felonious
Prevalent proposition with 9's
Ducky was well-aware
They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
He figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides
Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line
Two extra biscuits, Anthony liked him
And then let him slide; they didn't kill him
In fact, it look like they're the last to survive
Pay attention, that one decision changed both of they lives
One curse at a time
Reverse the manifest and good karma, and I'll tell you why
You take two strangers, and put 'em in random predicaments; give 'em a soul
So they can make their own choices and live with it
Twenty years later, them same strangers you make 'em meet again
Inside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits
Then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident
Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?
Because if Anthony killed Ducky
Top Dawg could be servin' life
While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight
So, I was takin' a walk the other day…
This what God feel like, huh, yeah
Laughin' to the bank like, "A-ha!", huh, yeah
Flex on swole like, "A-ha!", huh, yeah
You feel some type of way, then a-ha!
Huh, yeah (a-ha-ha, a-ha-ha)
Ever since a young man
All I wanted to be was a gunman
Shootin’ up the charts, better run, man
Y'all gotta see that I won, man
Slick as El DeBarge with the finger waves, work it, JT
Handle bars like a fade, watch me work it, JT
I'm at large, runnin’ plays like a circuit, JT
I'm sellin' verses, Jay Z, watch me work it, JT
Look, look… hol' up!
Don't judge me, my mama caught me with a strap
Don't judge me, I was young, fuckin' all the rats
Don't judge me, aimin’ at your head for a stack
Don’t judge me! Don't judge me!
Now my home got a Valley peak
Don’t judge me, if I press your line you a freak
Don't judge me, won't you tell a friend y'all gon’ see—
This what God feel like, huh, yeah
Laughin' to the bank like, "A-ha!", huh, yeah
Flex on swole like, "A-ha!", huh, yeah
You feel some type of way, then a-ha!
Huh, yeah (a-ha-ha, a-ha-ha)
Fuck is you talkin' to?
Aye, do you know who you talkin' to?
Slide on you like fallen drapes
God toss full of carnivals
I kill 'em with kindness
Or I kill 'em with diamonds
Or I put up like fifteen hundred
Get yo' ass killed by the finest
Everything in life is a gamble
Nothin' in life I can't handle
Seen it all, done it all, felt pain more
For the cars, I done put blood on sword
Everything I do is to embrace y'all
Everything I write is a damn eight ball
Everything I touch is a damn gold mine
Everything I say is from an angel
I don't rush shit, fuck shit
Always your shit, my shit
Cannonballs to ignite shit
Morning to the night shift
I'm on, I ain't sorry for it
Ask for a piece of mine, you charged me for it
I wanna see sometimes if you ignore it
I'm in the streets sometimes and can't afford it
I got a bad habit
Levitate, duckin' haters
Oh my! My heart is rich, my heart is famous
This what God feel like
Huh, yeah (this what God feel like)
Laughin' to the bank like, "A-ha!"
(This what God feel like)
Huh, yeah (this what God feel like)
Flex on swole like, "A-ha!"
(This what God feel like)
Huh, yeah (this what God feel like)
You feel some type of way, then a-ha!
(This what God feel like)
Huh, yeah (this what God feel like)
This what God feel like
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth
What’s up, family? Yeah, it's yo cousin Carl, man, just givin' you a call, man. I know you been havin’ a lot on yo mind lately, and I know you feel like, you know, people ain't been prayin' for you. But you have to understand this, man, that we are a cursed people. Deuteronomy 28:28 says, "The Lord shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and astonishment of heart." See, family, that's why you feel like you feel like you got a chip on your shoulder. Until you finally get the memo, you will always feel that way…
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Pain in my heart carry burdens full of struggle
Why God, why God do I gotta bleed?
Every stone thrown at you restin' at my feet
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Earth is no more, won't you burn this muh'fucka?
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth
I beat yo ass, keep talkin’ back
I beat yo ass, who bought you that?
You stole it, I beat yo ass if you say that game is broken
I beat yo ass if you jump on my couch
I beat yo ass if you walk in this house
With tears in your eyes, runnin’ from Poo Poo and Prentice
Go back outside, I beat yo ass, lil nigga
That homework better be finished, I beat yo ass
Your teachers better not be bitchin' ’bout you in class
That pizza better not be wasted, you eat it all
That TV better not be loud if you got it on
Them Jordans better not get dirty when I just bought 'em
Better not hear 'bout you humpin' on Keisha’s daughter
Better not hear you got caught up
I beat yo ass, you better not run to your father
I beat yo ass, you know my patience runnin' thin
I got beaucoup payments to make
County building's on my ass
Tryna take my food stamps away
I beat yo ass if you tell them social workers he live here
I beat yo ass if I beat yo ass twice and you still here
Seven years old, think you run this house by yourself?
Nigga, you gon' fear me if you don't fear no one else
If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucka up
And then I'd take two puffs
I'm high now, I'm high now
I'm high now, I'm high now
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth
I'll prolly die anonymous
I'll prolly die with promises
I'll prolly die walkin' back home from the candy house
I'll prolly die because these colors are standin' out
I'll prolly die because I ain't know Demarcus was snitchin'
I'll prolly die at these house parties, fuckin' with bitches
I'll prolly die from witnesses leavin' me falsed accused
I'll prolly die from thinkin' that me and your hood was cool
Or maybe die from pressin' the line, actin' too extra
Or maybe die because these smokers
Are more than desperate
I'll prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges
Body slammed on black and white paint, my bones snappin'
Or maybe die from panic or die from bein' too lax
Or die from waitin' on it, die 'cause I'm movin' too fast
I'll prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments
I'll prolly die tryna diffuse two homies arguin'
I'll prolly die 'cause that's what you do when you're 17
All worries in a hurry, I wish I controlled things
If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucka up
And then I'd take two puffs
I've been hungry all my life
I'm high now, I'm high now
I'm high now, I'm high now
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
Now…
When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the bad girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out
And just kill somethin', drill somethin'
Get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say 'bout me reveal
If my reputation would miss me
What they see from me
Would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me
Would make 'em highlight my simplest lines
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me
So hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me
So hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
Damn
Goddamn you
Goddamn me
Goddamn us
Goddamn we
Goddamn us all
Verse two says you only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities. So until we come back to these commandments, until you come back to these commandments, we're gonna feel this way, we're gonna be under this curse. Because he said he's gonna punish us, the so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians, are the true children of Israel. We are the Israelites according to the Bible. The children of Israel, he's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience, because we chose to follow other gods that aren't his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee. So, just like you chasten your own son, he's gonna chastise you because he loves you. So that's why we get chastised, that's why we're in the position we're in. Until we come back to these laws, statutes and commandments, and do what the Lord said, these curses are gonna be upon us. We're gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live here in today, in the United States of America. I love you, son, and I pray for you. God bless you, shalom.
America, God bless you if it's good to you
America please take my hand
Can you help me underst-
New Kung Fu Kenny
Throw a steak off the yacht
To a pool full of sharks, he'll take it
Leave him in the wilderness
With a sworn nemesis, he'll make it
Take the gratitude from him
I bet he'll show you something, woah
I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothing
I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothing
I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothing
I'll chip a nigga then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like bitch I did that x-rated
Johnny don't wanna go to school no more, no more
Johnny said books ain't cool no more (no more)
Johnny wanna be a rapper like his big cousin
Johnny caught a body yesterday out hustlin'
God bless America you know we all love him
Yesterday I got a call like from my dog like 101
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
Talkin' out his head philosphing on what the lord had done
He said, "K-Dot can you pray for me?
It's been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome"
He was lookin' for some closure
Hopin' I could bring him closer
To the spiritual, my spirit do no better, but I told him
"I can't sugar coat the answer for you
This is how I feel—if somebody kill my son
That mean somebody's gettin' killed"
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch
I wait in front a niggas spot and watch him hit his block
I'll catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all I got
I'll chip a nigga then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, "Bitch I did that"
Ain't no black power when your baby killed by a coward
I can't even keep the peace, don't you fuck with one of ours
It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird on the street, paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my momma
Touch my sister, touch my woman
Touch my daddy, touch my niece
Touch my nephew, touch my brother
You should chip a nigga then throw the blower in his lap
Matter fact, I'm 'bout to speak at this convention
Call you back
Alright kids we're gonna talk about gun control
(Pray for me)
Damn
It's not a place
This country is to be a sound of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look around
Hail Mary, Jesus and Joseph
The great American flag
Is wrapped and dragged with explosives
Compulsive disorder, sons and daughters
Barricaded blocks and borders
Look what you taught us
It's murder on my street, w'all street, back streets
Wall street, corporate offices, banks
Employees and bosses with homicidal thoughts
Donald Trump's in office, we lost Barack
And promised to never doubt him again
But is America honest or do we bask in sin?
Pass the gin, I mix it with American blood
Then bash him in, you crippin'ìg or you married to blood?
I'll ask again—oops—accident
It's nasty when you set us up
Then roll the dice, then bet us up
You overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us
Gang members or terrorists, et cetera, et cetera
Americas reflections of me
That's what a mirror does
It's not a place
This country is to be a sound of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look ar-
Damn
Love or lust
Damn
All of us

Bad attitude for your nanny
Curvin' your hit from yo' mammy

I know Top will be mad at me

I need some water
Somethin' came over me
Way too hot to simmer down
Might as well overheat
Too close to comfort
As blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racin' like a junkie's
I just need you to want me
Am I askin' too much?
Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that
Girl, I respect the cat
I promise just a touch
Let me put the head in
If it's okay
She said, "It's okay."
Yeah, I need everybody's motherfuckin' hands up right now
I need everybody's motherfuckin'—
Door and his Nike Air Rattles
Rush the fire exit, no time for battles
Well I, I never expected
This that new shit
This that new, new shit
Wake up in the mornin'
Thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch
Don't go to work today, cop you a fit
Or maybe some kicks and make you—
Door in his Nike Air Rattles
Rush the fire exit, no time for battles
Well I, I never expected
Wake up in the mornin'
Thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy— hol' up!
Wake up in the mornin'
Thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch, don't go to work today
Cop you a fit or maybe some kicks and make it work today
Hang with your homies, stunt on your baby mama
Sip some lean, go get a pistol, shoot out the window
Bet your favorite team, play you some Madden
Go to the club or your mama house
Whatever you doin', just make it count
(I need some water)
Wake up in the mornin'
Thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Hop in the shower, put on your makeup, lace your weave up
Touch on yourself, call up your nigga, tell him he ain't shit
Credit card scam, get you a Visa, make him pay your rent
Hop on the 'Gram, flex on the bitches that be hatin' on you
Pop you a pill, call up your bitches, have 'em waitin' on you
Go to the club, have you some fun, make that ass bounce
It's whatever, just make it count
I need some water
Somethin' came over me
Way too hot to simmer down
Might as well overheat
Too close to comfort
As blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racin' like a junkie's
I just need you to want me
Am I askin' too much?
Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that
Girl, I respect the cat
I promise just a touch
Let me put the head in
If it's okay
She said, "It's okay."
I wake in the mornin', my head spinnin' from the last night
Both in the trance, feelings I did—what a fast life!
Manager called, the lobby called, it's 11:30
Did this before, promised myself I'd be a hour early
Room full of clothes, bag full of money: call it loose change
Fumbled my jewelry, 100k, I lost a new chain
Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M
Take me a nap and do it again
We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news
Lookin' for confirmation, hopin' election wasn't true
All of us worried, all of us buried, and our feeling's deep
None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap
Still and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it
Bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly
Time passin', things change
Revertin' back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways; Lust
Lately, I feel like I been lustin' over the fame
Lately, we lust on the same routine of shame
Lately, lately, lately, my lust been hidin' (Lately)
Lately, it’s all contradiction
Lately, I’m not here
Lately, I lust over self
Lust turn into fear
Lately, in James 4:4 says
Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord
Brace yourself, lust is all yours
I need some water
Somethin' came over me
Way too high to simmer down
Might as well overheat
Too close to comfort
As blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racin' like a junkie's
I just need you to want me
Am I askin' too much?
Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that
Girl, I respect the cat
I promise just a touch
Let me put the head in
If it's okay
She said, "It's okay."
Wicked or weakness
You gotta see this
Waaaaay (yeah, yeah!)
Nobody pray for me
If you're not there for me
Waaaaay (yeah, yeah!)
Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits
But now I’m countin' this
Parmesan where my accountant lives
In fact, I'm downin’ this
D'USSÉ with my boo bae, tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy yo' ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
A.M. to the P.M., P.M. to the A.M., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know, bitch, be humble

Who dat nigga thinkin' that he frontin' on Man-Man? (Man-Man)
Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman)
Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
I make a play fuckin' up your whole life
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still will take you down right on your mama's couch in Polo socks, ayy
This shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy
I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy
I don't fabricate it, ayy, most of y'all be fakin', ayy

Love's gonna get you killed
But pride’s gonna be the death of you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me and—
It wasn't all to share, but there
In another life, I surely was there
It wasn't all to share, but there
I care, I care
Hell-raising, wheel-chasing, new worldy possessions
Flesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen?
The better part, the human heart
You love ’em or dissect 'em
Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
See, in the perfect world, I would be perfect, world
I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world
I don't love people enough to put my faith in men
I put my faith in these lyrics, hoping I make amend
I understand I ain't perfect
I probably won't come around
This time, I might put you down
Last time, I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now
My feelings might go numb, you're dealing with cold thumb
I’m willing to give up a leg and arm and show empathy from
Pity parties and functions and you and yours
A perfect world, you probably live another 24
I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
It wasn't all to share, but there
In another life, I surely was there
It wasn't all to share, but there
I care, I care
Maybe I wasn’t there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Now, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive
Cold as December, but never remember what Winter did
I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays
Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior of you and I
See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches
I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison
I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world
It wasn't all to share, but there
In another life, I surely was there
It wasn't all to share, but there
I care, I care
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (fired, fire)
All I want tonight just get high up (high, high, high)
Girl, you look so good, it's to die for (die for)
Ooh that pussy good, it's to die for (on fire)
It's a secret society
All we ask is trust
(All we ask is trust)
All we got is us
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Kung Fu Kenny, now
My resume is real enough for two millenniums
A better way to make a wave's not defendin' them
I meditate and moderate all of my wins again
I'm hangin' on the fence again
I'm always on your mind
I put my lyric and my lifeline on the line
And ain't no limit when I might shine, might grind
You rollin' with it at the right time, right now
(Only for the dollar sign)
Bad gyal RiRi, now
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve, deeper now
On your pulse like a CD in
Gas in the bitch like it's premium
Haul ass on a bitch all in the fast lane
Been a bad bitch way before any cash came
I'm established
Hundred carats on my name, run the atlas
I'm a natural, I'm alright
I'm a savage, I'm an asshole, I'm a king
Shimmy-yeah, shimmy-yeah, shimmy-yeah, rock
You can tell your nigga he can meet me outside (yeah)
You can babysit him when I leave him outside
Ain't no other love like the one I know
I done been down so long I slowed
I done came down so hard I slowed
I don't sleep forever, all a real nigga want
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (fired, fire)
All I want is tonight is just to get high up (yeah)
(all I want is, all I want is)
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
10-4, no switching sides
Feel somethin' wrong
You acting shifty, you don't ride
With me no more, I need
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it money? Is it fame? Is it weed? Is it drink?
Is it comin' down with the loud pipes and the rain?
Big chillin', only for the power in your name
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it love for the streets when the lights get dark?
Is it unconditional when the 'Rari don't start?
Tell me when your loyalty is comin' from the heart
Tell me who you loyal to
Do it start with your women or your man? (Mmm)
Do it end with your family and friends? (Mmm)
Or you're loyal to yourself in advance?
I said, tell me who you loyal to
Is it anybody that you would lie for?
Anybody you would slide for?
Anybody you would die for?
That's what God for
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (fired, fire)
All I want tonight is just to get high up
(All I want is, all I want is)
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
10-4, no switching sides
Feel somethin' wrong
You acting shifty, you don't ride
With me no more, I need
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
It's so hard to be humble
It's so hard to be
Lord knows is I'm trying
Lord knows is I'm dying, baby
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
I feel like a chip on my shoulders
I feel like I'm losin' my focus
I feel like I'm losin' my patience
I feel like my thoughts in the basement
Feel like, I feel like you're miseducated
Feel like I don't wanna be bothered
I feel like you may be the problem
I feel like it ain't no tomorrow, fuck the world
The world is endin', I'm done pretendin'
And fuck you if you get offended
I feel like friends been overrated
I feel like the family been fakin'
I feel like the feelings are changin'
Feel like my daughter compromised and jaded
Feel like you wanna scrutinize how I made it
Feel like I ain't feelin' you all
Feel like removin' myself, no feelings involved
I feel for you, I've been in the field for you
It's real for you, right? Shit, I feel like—

I feel like all it take is a second to feel like
Mike Jordan whenever holdin' a real mic
I ain't feelin' your presence
Feel like I'ma learn you a lesson
Feel like only me and the music, though
I feel like your feelin' ain't mutual
I feel like the enemy you should know
Feel like the feelin' of no hope
The feelin' of bad dope
A quarter ounce manipulated from soap
The feelin', the feelin' of false freedom
I'll force-feed 'em the poison that fill 'em up in the prison
I feel like it's just me
Look, I feel like I can't breathe
Look, I feel like I can't sleep
Look, I feel heartless, often off this
Feelin' of fallin', of fallin' apart with
Darkest hours, lost it
Fillin' the void of bein' employed with ballin'
Streets is talkin', fill in the blanks with coffins
Fill up the banks with dollars
Fill up the graves with fathers
Fill up the babies with bullshit
Internet blogs and pulpit, fill 'em with gossip
I feel like this gotta be the feelin' what 'Pac was
The feelin' of an apocalypse happenin'
But nothin' is awkward, the feelin' won't prosper
The feelin' is toxic, I feel like I'm boxin' demons
Monsters, false prophets schemin'
Sponsors, industry promises
Niggas, bitches, honkies, crackers, Compton
Church, religion, token blacks, and bondage
Lawsuit visits, subpoena served in concert
Fuck your feelings, I mean this for imposters
I can feel it, the phoenix sure to watch us
I can feel it, the dream is more than process
I can put a regime that forms a Loch Ness
I can feel it, the scream that haunts our logic
I feel like say somethin', I feel like take somethin'
I feel like skatin' off, I feel like waitin' for 'em
Maybe it's too late for 'em
I feel like the whole world want me to pray for 'em

I'll take your fuckin' life for this shit, nigga
We ain't goin' back to broke, family sellin' dope
That's why you maney-ass rap niggas better know
If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element
I'm allergic to a bitch nigga, ayy
An imaginary rich nigga, ayy
Seven figures, hoe, that slimmer than my bitch figure, ayy
Goin' digital and physical on all y'all, ayy

We okay, we let the A1 fly
Relocate, jump on the same G5
Checkin' for me heavy 'cause I go yeah, I go yeah
They never been ready—yeah, I know yeah, know yeah
100K spread across the floor, 'cross the floor, yeah
None of y'all fuckin' with the flow yeah, the flow yeah
Years in the makin', and don't y'all mistake it
I got 'em by a landslide, we talkin' about races
You know this'll never be a tie, just look at their laces
You know careers take off, just gotta be patient
Mr. One through Five, that's the only logic
Fake my death, go to Cuba, that's the only option
If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element
Damned if I do, if I don't (yuhhh)
Goddamn us all if you won't (yuhhh)
Damn, damn, damn, it's a goddamn shame
You ain't frontline, get out the goddamn way
Niggas thought they wasn't gonna see me, huh?
Niggas thought that K-Dot real life
Was the same life they see on TV, huh?
Niggas wanna flex on me and be in L.A. for free, huh?
Next time they hit the 10 freeway, we need receipt, huh?
'Cause most of y'all ain't real
Most of y'all gon' squeal
Most of y'all just envy, but jealousy get you killed
Most of y'all throw rocks and try to hide your hand
Just say his name and I promise that you'll see Candyman
Because it's all in your eyes, most of y'all tell lies
Most of y'all don't fade, most of y'all been advised
Last LP I tried to lift the black artists
But it's a difference between black artists and wack artists
[Outro: Kendrick Lamar & Kid Capri]
If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
It's the one and only, the world's greatest, the Kid Capri
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element
New shit, new Kung Fu Kenny
I got so many theories and suspicions
I'm diagnosed with real nigga conditions
Today is the day I follow my intuition
Keep the family close—get money, fuck bitches
I double parked the Aston in the red
My mama told me that I'ma work myself to death
My girl told me don't let these hoes get in my head
My world been ecstatic, I checked the signal that read—
Buzzin', radars is buzzin'
Yah, yah, yah, yah
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
Buzzin', radars is buzzin'
Yah, yah, yah, yah
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
Interviews wanna know my thoughts and opinions
Fox News wanna use my name for percentage
My latest muse is my niece, she worth livin'
See me on the TV and scream: "That's Uncle Kendrick!"
Yeah, that's the business
Somebody tell Geraldo this nigga got some ambition
I'm not a politician, I'm not 'bout a religion
I'm a Israelite, don't call me Black no mo'
That word is only a color, it ain't facts no mo'
My cousin called, my cousin Carl Duckworth
Said know my worth
And Deuteronomy say that we all been cursed
I know he walks the Earth
But it's money to get, bitches to hit, yah

I got, I got, I got, I got
Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle though, ambition, flow, inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this
Immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this
Was Yeshua's new weapon
I don’t contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got
Realness, I just kill shit 'cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin’ in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil, that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome, heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve
Yeah, that's him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a—
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you
This is Paula’s oldest son
I know murder, conviction
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids
And I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s DNA
Born inside the beast
My expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn't have nowhere to stay
At 29, I’ve done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I'm supposed to
Antisocial, extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And that’s a riff, gonna plead this case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better, fuck your life
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the makin' of marriages
Tell me somethin'
You mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you're in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy and walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows, I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder—these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder—our DNA
Is it wickedness?
Is it weakness?
You decide
Are we gonna live or die?
So I was takin' a walk the other day, and I seen a woman—a blind woman—pacin' up and down the sidewalk. She seemed to be a bit frustrated, as if she had dropped somethin' and havin' a hard time findin' it. So after watchin' her struggle for a while, I decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know? "Hello, ma'am, can I be of any assistance? It seems to me that you have lost something. I would like to help you find it." She replied: "Oh yes, you have lost something. You've lost your life."
Is it wickedness?
Lamar stated his views on police brutality with that line in the song, quote: "And we hate the popo, wanna kill us in the street fo' sho'…"
Oh please, ugh, I don't like it.

Kung Fu Kenny, now
My resume is real enough for two millenniums
A better way to make a wave's not defendin' them
I meditate and moderate all of my wins again
I'm hangin' on the fence again
I'm always on your mind
I put my lyric and my lifeline on the line
And ain't no limit when I might shine, might grind
You rollin' with it at the right time, right now
(Only for the dollar sign)
Bad gyal RiRi, now
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve, deeper now
On your pulse like a CD in
Gas in the bitch like it's premium
Haul ass on a bitch all in the fast lane
Been a bad bitch way before any cash came
I'm established
Hundred carats on my name, run the atlas
I'm a natural, I'm alright
I'm a savage, I'm an asshole, I'm a king
Shimmy-yeah, shimmy-yeah, shimmy-yeah, rock
You can tell your nigga he can meet me outside (yeah)
You can babysit him when I leave him outside
Ain't no other love like the one I know

I done came down so hard I slowed
I don't sleep forever, all a real nigga want

With me no more, I need

Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it money? Is it fame? Is it weed? Is it drink?
Is it comin' down with the loud pipes and the rain?
Big chillin', only for the power in your name
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it love for the streets when the lights get dark?
Is it unconditional when the 'Rari don't start?
Tell me when your loyalty is comin' from the heart
Tell me who you loyal to
Do it start with your women or your man? (Mmm)
Do it end with your family and friends? (Mmm)
Or you're loyal to yourself in advance?
I said, tell me who you loyal to
Is it anybody that you would lie for?
Anybody you would slide for?
Anybody you would die for?
That's what God for
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (fired, fire)

And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me and—
It wasn't all to share, but there
In another life, I surely was there
It wasn't all to share, but there
I care, I care
Hell-raising, wheel-chasing, new worldy possessions
Flesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen?
The better part, the human heart
You love ’em or dissect 'em
Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
See, in the perfect world, I would be perfect, world
I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world
I don't love people enough to put my faith in men
I put my faith in these lyrics, hoping I make amend
I understand I ain't perfect
I probably won't come around
This time, I might put you down
Last time, I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now
My feelings might go numb, you're dealing with cold thumb
I’m willing to give up a leg and arm and show empathy from
Pity parties and functions and you and yours
A perfect world, you probably live another 24
I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
It wasn't all to share, but there
In another life, I surely was there
It wasn't all to share, but there
I care, I care
Maybe I wasn’t there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Now, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive
Cold as December, but never remember what Winter did
I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays
Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior of you and I
See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches
I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison
I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world
It wasn't all to share, but there
In another life, I surely was there
It wasn't all to share, but there
I care, I care
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Wicked or weakness
You gotta see this
Waaaaay (yeah, yeah!)
Nobody pray for me
If you're not there for me
Waaaaay (yeah, yeah!)
Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits
But now I’m countin' this
Parmesan where my accountant lives
In fact, I'm downin’ this
D'USSÉ with my boo bae, tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy yo' ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
A.M. to the P.M., P.M. to the A.M., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know, bitch, be humble
(Hol’ up, bitch) sit down

Who dat nigga thinkin' that he frontin' on Man-Man? (Man-Man)
Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman)
Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
I make a play fuckin' up your whole life
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still will take you down right on your mama's couch in Polo socks, ayy
This shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy
I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy
I don't fabricate it, ayy, most of y'all be fakin', ayy
I stay modest 'bout it, ayy, she elaborate it, ayy
This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ayy
Watch my soul speak, you let the meds talk, ayy
If I kill a nigga, it won't be the alcohol, ayy
I'm the realest nigga after all, bitch, be humble

I need some water
Somethin' came over me
Way too hot to simmer down
Might as well overheat
Too close to comfort
As blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racin' like a junkie's
I just need you to want me
Am I askin' too much?
Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that
Girl, I respect the cat
I promise just a touch
Let me put the head in
If it's okay
She said, "It's okay."
Yeah, I need everybody's motherfuckin' hands up right now
I need everybody's motherfuckin'—
Door and his Nike Air Rattles
Rush the fire exit, no time for battles
Well I, I never expected
This that new shit
This that new, new shit
Wake up in the mornin'
Thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch
Don't go to work today, cop you a fit
Or maybe some kicks and make you—
Door in his Nike Air Rattles
Rush the fire exit, no time for battles
Well I, I never expected
Wake up in the mornin'
Thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy— hol' up!
Wake up in the mornin'
Thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch, don't go to work today
Cop you a fit or maybe some kicks and make it work today
Hang with your homies, stunt on your baby mama
Sip some lean, go get a pistol, shoot out the window
Bet your favorite team, play you some Madden
Go to the club or your mama house
Whatever you doin', just make it count
(I need some water)
Wake up in the mornin'
Thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Hop in the shower, put on your makeup, lace your weave up
Touch on yourself, call up your nigga, tell him he ain't shit
Credit card scam, get you a Visa, make him pay your rent
Hop on the 'Gram, flex on the bitches that be hatin' on you
Pop you a pill, call up your bitches, have 'em waitin' on you
Go to the club, have you some fun, make that ass bounce
It's whatever, just make it count
I need some water
Somethin' came over me
Way too hot to simmer down
Might as well overheat
Too close to comfort
As blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racin' like a junkie's
I just need you to want me
Am I askin' too much?
Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that
Girl, I respect the cat
I promise just a touch
Let me put the head in
If it's okay
She said, "It's okay."
I wake in the mornin', my head spinnin' from the last night
Both in the trance, feelings I did—what a fast life!
Manager called, the lobby called, it's 11:30
Did this before, promised myself I'd be a hour early
Room full of clothes, bag full of money: call it loose change
Fumbled my jewelry, 100k, I lost a new chain
Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M
Take me a nap and do it again
We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news
Lookin' for confirmation, hopin' election wasn't true
All of us worried, all of us buried, and our feeling's deep
None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap
Still and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it
Bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly
Time passin', things change
Revertin' back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways; Lust
Lately, I feel like I been lustin' over the fame
Lately, we lust on the same routine of shame
Lately, lately, lately, my lust been hidin' (Lately)
Lately, it’s all contradiction
Lately, I’m not here
Lately, I lust over self
Lust turn into fear
Lately, in James 4:4 says
Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord
Brace yourself, lust is all yours
I need some water
Somethin' came over me
Way too high to simmer down
Might as well overheat
Too close to comfort
As blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racin' like a junkie's
I just need you to want me
Am I askin' too much?
Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that
Girl, I respect the cat
I promise just a touch
Let me put the head in
If it's okay
She said, "It's okay."
Damn
Love or lust
Damn
All of us

Only for life, you're a homie for life
You're a homie for life, let's get it
Hit that shoulder lean, I know what comin' over mean
Backstroke oversea, I know what you need

I wanna be with you, ayy, I wanna be with
I wanna be with you, ayy, I wanna be with

We ain't got no time to waste
Popping your gum on the way
Am I in the way?
I don't want to pressure you none
I want your blessing today
Oh by the way, open the door by the way
Told you that I'm on the way
I'm on the way, I know connection is vague
Pick up the phone for me babe
Dammit, we jammin'
Bad attitude for your nanny
Curvin' your hit from yo' mammy
Remember Gardena, I took the studio camera
I know Top will be mad at me

America please take my hand
Can you help me underst-
New Kung Fu Kenny
Throw a steak off the yacht
To a pool full of sharks, he'll take it
Leave him in the wilderness
With a sworn nemesis, he'll make it
Take the gratitude from him
I bet he'll show you something, woah
I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothing
I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothing
I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothing
I'll chip a nigga then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like bitch I did that x-rated
Johnny don't wanna go to school no more, no more
Johnny said books ain't cool no more (no more)
Johnny wanna be a rapper like his big cousin
Johnny caught a body yesterday out hustlin'
God bless America you know we all love him
Yesterday I got a call like from my dog like 101
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
Talkin' out his head philosphing on what the lord had done
He said, "K-Dot can you pray for me?
It's been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome"
He was lookin' for some closure
Hopin' I could bring him closer
To the spiritual, my spirit do no better, but I told him
"I can't sugar coat the answer for you
This is how I feel—if somebody kill my son
That mean somebody's gettin' killed"
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch
I wait in front a niggas spot and watch him hit his block
I'll catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all I got
I'll chip a nigga then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, "Bitch I did that"
Ain't no black power when your baby killed by a coward
I can't even keep the peace, don't you fuck with one of ours
It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird on the street, paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my momma
Touch my sister, touch my woman
Touch my daddy, touch my niece
Touch my nephew, touch my brother
You should chip a nigga then throw the blower in his lap
Matter fact, I'm 'bout to speak at this convention
Call you back
Alright kids we're gonna talk about gun control
(Pray for me)
Damn
It's not a place
This country is to be a sound of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look around
Hail Mary, Jesus and Joseph
The great American flag
Is wrapped and dragged with explosives
Compulsive disorder, sons and daughters
Barricaded blocks and borders
Look what you taught us
It's murder on my street, w'all street, back streets
Wall street, corporate offices, banks
Employees and bosses with homicidal thoughts
Donald Trump's in office, we lost Barack
And promised to never doubt him again
But is America honest or do we bask in sin?
Pass the gin, I mix it with American blood
Then bash him in, you crippin'ìg or you married to blood?
I'll ask again—oops—accident
It's nasty when you set us up
Then roll the dice, then bet us up
You overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us
Gang members or terrorists, et cetera, et cetera
Americas reflections of me
That's what a mirror does
It's not a place
This country is to be a sound of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look ar-
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth
What’s up, family? Yeah, it's yo cousin Carl, man, just givin' you a call, man. I know you been havin’ a lot on yo mind lately, and I know you feel like, you know, people ain't been prayin' for you. But you have to understand this, man, that we are a cursed people. Deuteronomy 28:28 says, "The Lord shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and astonishment of heart." See, family, that's why you feel like you feel like you got a chip on your shoulder. Until you finally get the memo, you will always feel that way…
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Pain in my heart carry burdens full of struggle
Why God, why God do I gotta bleed?
Every stone thrown at you restin' at my feet
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Earth is no more, won't you burn this muh'fucka?
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth
I beat yo ass, keep talkin’ back
I beat yo ass, who bought you that?
You stole it, I beat yo ass if you say that game is broken
I beat yo ass if you jump on my couch
I beat yo ass if you walk in this house
With tears in your eyes, runnin’ from Poo Poo and Prentice
Go back outside, I beat yo ass, lil nigga
That homework better be finished, I beat yo ass
Your teachers better not be bitchin' ’bout you in class
That pizza better not be wasted, you eat it all
That TV better not be loud if you got it on
Them Jordans better not get dirty when I just bought 'em
Better not hear 'bout you humpin' on Keisha’s daughter
Better not hear you got caught up
I beat yo ass, you better not run to your father
I beat yo ass, you know my patience runnin' thin
I got beaucoup payments to make
County building's on my ass
Tryna take my food stamps away
I beat yo ass if you tell them social workers he live here
I beat yo ass if I beat yo ass twice and you still here
Seven years old, think you run this house by yourself?
Nigga, you gon' fear me if you don't fear no one else
If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucka up
And then I'd take two puffs
I'm high now, I'm high now
I'm high now, I'm high now
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth
I'll prolly die anonymous
I'll prolly die with promises
I'll prolly die walkin' back home from the candy house
I'll prolly die because these colors are standin' out
I'll prolly die because I ain't know Demarcus was snitchin'
I'll prolly die at these house parties, fuckin' with bitches
I'll prolly die from witnesses leavin' me falsed accused
I'll prolly die from thinkin' that me and your hood was cool
Or maybe die from pressin' the line, actin' too extra
Or maybe die because these smokers
Are more than desperate
I'll prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges
Body slammed on black and white paint, my bones snappin'
Or maybe die from panic or die from bein' too lax
Or die from waitin' on it, die 'cause I'm movin' too fast
I'll prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments
I'll prolly die tryna diffuse two homies arguin'
I'll prolly die 'cause that's what you do when you're 17
All worries in a hurry, I wish I controlled things
If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucka up
And then I'd take two puffs
I've been hungry all my life
I'm high now, I'm high now
I'm high now, I'm high now
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
Now…
When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the bad girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out
And just kill somethin', drill somethin'
Get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say 'bout me reveal
If my reputation would miss me
What they see from me
Would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me
Would make 'em highlight my simplest lines
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me
So hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me
So hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
Damn
Goddamn you
Goddamn me
Goddamn us
Goddamn we
Goddamn us all
Verse two says you only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities. So until we come back to these commandments, until you come back to these commandments, we're gonna feel this way, we're gonna be under this curse. Because he said he's gonna punish us, the so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians, are the true children of Israel. We are the Israelites according to the Bible. The children of Israel, he's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience, because we chose to follow other gods that aren't his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee. So, just like you chasten your own son, he's gonna chastise you because he loves you. So that's why we get chastised, that's why we're in the position we're in. Until we come back to these laws, statutes and commandments, and do what the Lord said, these curses are gonna be upon us. We're gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live here in today, in the United States of America. I love you, son, and I pray for you. God bless you, shalom.
This what God feel like, huh, yeah
Laughin' to the bank like, "A-ha!", huh, yeah
Flex on swole like, "A-ha!", huh, yeah
You feel some type of way, then a-ha!

Don’t judge me, if I press your line you a freak
Don't judge me, won't you tell a friend y'all gon’ see—

Laughin' to the bank like, "A-ha!", huh, yeah

You feel some type of way, then a-ha!
Huh, yeah (a-ha-ha, a-ha-ha)
Fuck is you talkin' to?
Aye, do you know who you talkin' to?
Slide on you like fallen drapes
God toss full of carnivals
I kill 'em with kindness
Or I kill 'em with diamonds
Or I put up like fifteen hundred
Get yo' ass killed by the finest
Everything in life is a gamble
Nothin' in life I can't handle
Seen it all, done it all, felt pain more
For the cars, I done put blood on sword
Everything I do is to embrace y'all
Everything I write is a damn eight ball
Everything I touch is a damn gold mine
Everything I say is from an angel
I don't rush shit, fuck shit
Always your shit, my shit
Cannonballs to ignite shit
Morning to the night shift
I'm on, I ain't sorry for it
Ask for a piece of mine, you charged me for it
I wanna see sometimes if you ignore it
I'm in the streets sometimes and can't afford it
I got a bad habit
Levitate, duckin' haters
Oh my! My heart is rich, my heart is famous
This what God feel like
Huh, yeah (this what God feel like)
Laughin' to the bank like, "A-ha!"
(This what God feel like)
Huh, yeah (this what God feel like)
Flex on swole like, "A-ha!"
(This what God feel like)
Huh, yeah (this what God feel like)
You feel some type of way, then a-ha!
(This what God feel like)
Huh, yeah (this what God feel like)
This what God feel like
It was always me vs the world
Until I found it's me vs me
Why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why, why?
Just remember, what happens on Earth stays on Earth!
We gon' put it in reverse
Darling, I told you many times
And I am telling you once again
Just to remind you, sweetheart
That my—
Oh Lamar, Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard
Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark
Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star
Life is one funny mothafucka
A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him
I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep
Introverted by my thoughts
Children, listen, it gets deep
See, once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects
The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect
Adaptation inevitable: gun violence, crack spot
Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
Anthony was the oldest of seven
Well-respected, calm and collected
Laughin' and jokin' made life easier
Hard times, Momma on crack
A four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her
His family history: pimpin' and bangin'
He was meant to be dangerous
Clocked him a grip and start slangin'
Fifteen, scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces
Even got some head from a smoker last weekend
Dodged a policeman, workin' for his big homie
Small-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him
10,000 dollars out of a project housing, that's on the daily
Seen his first mil twenty years old, had a couple of babies
Had a couple of shooters
Caught a murder case, fingerprints on the gun they assumin'
But witnesses couldn't prove it
That was back when he turned his back
And they killed his cousin
He beat the case and went back to hustlin'
Bird-shufflin', Anthony rang
The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang
That 5.0 thing, they say 5-0 came
Circlin' parking lots and parking spots
And hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks
Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it
He brushed them off
And walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken
See, at this chicken spot
There was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot
With a curly top and a gap in his teeth
He worked the window, his name was Ducky
He came from the streets, the Robert Taylor Homes
Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome
Drove to California with a woman on him and 500 dollars
They had a son, hopin' that he'd see college
Hustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it
Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends
Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
'Cross the street from the projects
Anthony planned to rob it
Stuck up the place before, back in '84
That's when affiliation was really eight gears of war
So many relatives tellin' us, sellin' us devilish works
Killin' us, crime, intelligent, felonious
Prevalent proposition with 9's
Ducky was well-aware
They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
He figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides
Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line
Two extra biscuits, Anthony liked him
And then let him slide; they didn't kill him
In fact, it look like they're the last to survive
Pay attention, that one decision changed both of they lives
One curse at a time
Reverse the manifest and good karma, and I'll tell you why
You take two strangers, and put 'em in random predicaments; give 'em a soul
So they can make their own choices and live with it
Twenty years later, them same strangers you make 'em meet again
Inside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits
Then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident
Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?
Because if Anthony killed Ducky
Top Dawg could be servin' life
While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight
So, I was takin' a walk the other day…
Is it wickedness?
Is it weakness?
You decide
Are we gonna live or die?
So I was takin' a walk the other day, and I seen a woman—a blind woman—pacin' up and down the sidewalk. She seemed to be a bit frustrated, as if she had dropped somethin' and havin' a hard time findin' it. So after watchin' her struggle for a while, I decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know? "Hello, ma'am, can I be of any assistance? It seems to me that you have lost something. I would like to help you find it." She replied: "Oh yes, you have lost something. You've lost your life."
Is it wickedness?
Lamar stated his views on police brutality with that line in the song, quote: "And we hate the popo, wanna kill us in the street fo' sho'…"
Oh please, ugh, I don't like it.
I got, I got, I got, I got
Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle though, ambition, flow, inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this
Immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this
Was Yeshua's new weapon
I don’t contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got
Realness, I just kill shit 'cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin’ in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil, that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome, heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve
Yeah, that's him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a—
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you
This is Paula’s oldest son
I know murder, conviction
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids
And I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s DNA
Born inside the beast
My expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn't have nowhere to stay
At 29, I’ve done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I'm supposed to
Antisocial, extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And that’s a riff, gonna plead this case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better, fuck your life
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the makin' of marriages
Tell me somethin'
You mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you're in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy and walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows, I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder—these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder—our DNA
New shit, new Kung Fu Kenny
I got so many theories and suspicions
I'm diagnosed with real nigga conditions
Today is the day I follow my intuition
Keep the family close—get money, fuck bitches
I double parked the Aston in the red
My mama told me that I'ma work myself to death
My girl told me don't let these hoes get in my head
My world been ecstatic, I checked the signal that read—

See me on the TV and scream: "That's Uncle Kendrick!"
Yeah, that's the business
Somebody tell Geraldo this nigga got some ambition
I'm not a politician, I'm not 'bout a religion
I'm a Israelite, don't call me Black no mo'
That word is only a color, it ain't facts no mo'
My cousin called, my cousin Carl Duckworth

Bitch, all my grandmas dead
So ain't nobody prayin' for me, I'm on your head, ayy
Thirty millions later, know the feds watchin'
Auntie on my telegram, like, "Be cautious!"
I be hangin' out at Tam's, I be on Stockton
I don't do it for the 'Gram, I do it for Compton
I'm willin' to die for this shit, nigga
I'll take your fuckin' life for this shit, nigga
We ain't goin' back to broke, family sellin' dope
That's why you maney-ass rap niggas better know
If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element
I'm allergic to a bitch nigga, ayy
An imaginary rich nigga, ayy
Seven figures, hoe, that slimmer than my bitch figure, ayy
Goin' digital and physical on all y'all, ayy
Bunch of criminals and money in my phone calls, ayy
We okay, we let the A1 fly
Relocate, jump on the same G5
Checkin' for me heavy 'cause I go yeah, I go yeah

None of y'all fuckin' with the flow yeah, the flow yeah
Years in the makin', and don't y'all mistake it
I got 'em by a landslide, we talkin' about races
You know this'll never be a tie, just look at their laces
You know careers take off, just gotta be patient
Mr. One through Five, that's the only logic
Fake my death, go to Cuba, that's the only option
If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element
Damned if I do, if I don't (yuhhh)
Goddamn us all if you won't (yuhhh)
Damn, damn, damn, it's a goddamn shame
You ain't frontline, get out the goddamn way
Niggas thought they wasn't gonna see me, huh?
Niggas thought that K-Dot real life
Was the same life they see on TV, huh?
Niggas wanna flex on me and be in L.A. for free, huh?
Next time they hit the 10 freeway, we need receipt, huh?
'Cause most of y'all ain't real
Most of y'all gon' squeal
Most of y'all just envy, but jealousy get you killed
Most of y'all throw rocks and try to hide your hand
Just say his name and I promise that you'll see Candyman
Because it's all in your eyes, most of y'all tell lies
Most of y'all don't fade, most of y'all been advised
Last LP I tried to lift the black artists
But it's a difference between black artists and wack artists
[Outro: Kendrick Lamar & Kid Capri]
If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
It's the one and only, the world's greatest, the Kid Capri
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
I feel like a chip on my shoulders
I feel like I'm losin' my focus
I feel like I'm losin' my patience
I feel like my thoughts in the basement
Feel like, I feel like you're miseducated
Feel like I don't wanna be bothered
I feel like you may be the problem
I feel like it ain't no tomorrow, fuck the world
The world is endin', I'm done pretendin'
And fuck you if you get offended
I feel like friends been overrated
I feel like the family been fakin'
I feel like the feelings are changin'
Feel like my daughter compromised and jaded
Feel like you wanna scrutinize how I made it
Feel like I ain't feelin' you all
Feel like removin' myself, no feelings involved
I feel for you, I've been in the field for you
It's real for you, right? Shit, I feel like—
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin'
I feel niggas been out of pocket
I feel niggas tappin' they pockets
I feel like debating on who the greatest can stop it
I am legend, I feel like all of y'all is peasants
I feel like all of y'all is desperate
I feel like all it take is a second to feel like
Mike Jordan whenever holdin' a real mic
I ain't feelin' your presence
Feel like I'ma learn you a lesson
Feel like only me and the music, though
I feel like your feelin' ain't mutual
I feel like the enemy you should know
Feel like the feelin' of no hope
The feelin' of bad dope
A quarter ounce manipulated from soap
The feelin', the feelin' of false freedom
I'll force-feed 'em the poison that fill 'em up in the prison
I feel like it's just me
Look, I feel like I can't breathe
Look, I feel like I can't sleep
Look, I feel heartless, often off this
Feelin' of fallin', of fallin' apart with
Darkest hours, lost it
Fillin' the void of bein' employed with ballin'
Streets is talkin', fill in the blanks with coffins
Fill up the banks with dollars
Fill up the graves with fathers
Fill up the babies with bullshit
Internet blogs and pulpit, fill 'em with gossip
I feel like this gotta be the feelin' what 'Pac was
The feelin' of an apocalypse happenin'
But nothin' is awkward, the feelin' won't prosper
The feelin' is toxic, I feel like I'm boxin' demons
Monsters, false prophets schemin'
Sponsors, industry promises
Niggas, bitches, honkies, crackers, Compton
Church, religion, token blacks, and bondage
Lawsuit visits, subpoena served in concert
Fuck your feelings, I mean this for imposters
I can feel it, the phoenix sure to watch us
I can feel it, the dream is more than process
I can put a regime that forms a Loch Ness
I can feel it, the scream that haunts our logic
I feel like say somethin', I feel like take somethin'
I feel like skatin' off, I feel like waitin' for 'em
Maybe it's too late for 'em
I feel like the whole world want me to pray for 'em
But who the fuck prayin' for me?
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Who prayin' for me?
Ain't nobody prayin'
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (fired, fire)
All I want tonight just get high up (high, high, high)
Girl, you look so good, it's to die for (die for)
Ooh that pussy good, it's to die for (on fire)
It's a secret society
All we ask is trust
(All we ask is trust)
All we got is us
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Kung Fu Kenny, now
My resume is real enough for two millenniums
A better way to make a wave's not defendin' them
I meditate and moderate all of my wins again
I'm hangin' on the fence again
I'm always on your mind
I put my lyric and my lifeline on the line
And ain't no limit when I might shine, might grind
You rollin' with it at the right time, right now
(Only for the dollar sign)
Bad gyal RiRi, now
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve, deeper now
On your pulse like a CD in
Gas in the bitch like it's premium
Haul ass on a bitch all in the fast lane
Been a bad bitch way before any cash came
I'm established
Hundred carats on my name, run the atlas
I'm a natural, I'm alright
I'm a savage, I'm an asshole, I'm a king
Shimmy-yeah, shimmy-yeah, shimmy-yeah, rock
You can tell your nigga he can meet me outside (yeah)
You can babysit him when I leave him outside
Ain't no other love like the one I know
I done been down so long I slowed
I done came down so hard I slowed
I don't sleep forever, all a real nigga want
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (fired, fire)
All I want is tonight is just to get high up (yeah)
(all I want is, all I want is)
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
10-4, no switching sides
Feel somethin' wrong
You acting shifty, you don't ride
With me no more, I need
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it money? Is it fame? Is it weed? Is it drink?
Is it comin' down with the loud pipes and the rain?
Big chillin', only for the power in your name
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it love for the streets when the lights get dark?
Is it unconditional when the 'Rari don't start?
Tell me when your loyalty is comin' from the heart
Tell me who you loyal to
Do it start with your women or your man? (Mmm)
Do it end with your family and friends? (Mmm)
Or you're loyal to yourself in advance?
I said, tell me who you loyal to
Is it anybody that you would lie for?
Anybody you would slide for?
Anybody you would die for?
That's what God for
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (fired, fire)
All I want tonight is just to get high up
(All I want is, all I want is)
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
10-4, no switching sides
Feel somethin' wrong
You acting shifty, you don't ride
With me no more, I need
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
It's so hard to be humble
It's so hard to be
Lord knows is I'm trying
Lord knows is I'm dying, baby
Love's gonna get you killed
But pride’s gonna be the death of you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me and—
It wasn't all to share, but there
In another life, I surely was there
It wasn't all to share, but there
I care, I care
Hell-raising, wheel-chasing, new worldy possessions
Flesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen?
The better part, the human heart
You love ’em or dissect 'em
Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
See, in the perfect world, I would be perfect, world
I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world
I don't love people enough to put my faith in men
I put my faith in these lyrics, hoping I make amend
I understand I ain't perfect
I probably won't come around
This time, I might put you down
Last time, I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now
My feelings might go numb, you're dealing with cold thumb
I’m willing to give up a leg and arm and show empathy from
Pity parties and functions and you and yours
A perfect world, you probably live another 24
I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
It wasn't all to share, but there
In another life, I surely was there
It wasn't all to share, but there
I care, I care
Maybe I wasn’t there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Now, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive
Cold as December, but never remember what Winter did
I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays
Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior of you and I
See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches
I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison
I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world
It wasn't all to share, but there
In another life, I surely was there
It wasn't all to share, but there
I care, I care
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Wicked or weakness
You gotta see this
Waaaaay (yeah, yeah!)
Nobody pray for me
If you're not there for me
Waaaaay (yeah, yeah!)
Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits
But now I’m countin' this
Parmesan where my accountant lives
In fact, I'm downin’ this
D'USSÉ with my boo bae, tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy yo' ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
A.M. to the P.M., P.M. to the A.M., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know, bitch, be humble
(Hol’ up, bitch) sit down
(Hol’ up lil' bitch, hol’ up lil' bitch) be humble
(Hol' up, bitch) sit down

(Hol' up, bitch) sit down
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)
Who dat nigga thinkin' that he frontin' on Man-Man? (Man-Man)
Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman)
Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
I make a play fuckin' up your whole life
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still will take you down right on your mama's couch in Polo socks, ayy
This shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy
I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy
I don't fabricate it, ayy, most of y'all be fakin', ayy
I stay modest 'bout it, ayy, she elaborate it, ayy
This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ayy
Watch my soul speak, you let the meds talk, ayy
If I kill a nigga, it won't be the alcohol, ayy
I'm the realest nigga after all, bitch, be humble
(Hol' up, bitch) sit down
(Hol' up lil' bitch, hol' up lil' bitch) be humble
(Hol' up, bitch) sit down
(Sit down, hol' up, lil' bitch)

(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)
I need some water
Somethin' came over me
Way too hot to simmer down
Might as well overheat
Too close to comfort
As blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racin' like a junkie's
I just need you to want me
Am I askin' too much?
Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that
Girl, I respect the cat
I promise just a touch
Let me put the head in
If it's okay
She said, "It's okay."
Yeah, I need everybody's motherfuckin' hands up right now
I need everybody's motherfuckin'—
Door and his Nike Air Rattles
Rush the fire exit, no time for battles
Well I, I never expected
This that new shit
This that new, new shit
Wake up in the mornin'
Thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch
Don't go to work today, cop you a fit
Or maybe some kicks and make you—
Door in his Nike Air Rattles
Rush the fire exit, no time for battles
Well I, I never expected
Wake up in the mornin'
Thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy— hol' up!
Wake up in the mornin'
Thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch, don't go to work today
Cop you a fit or maybe some kicks and make it work today
Hang with your homies, stunt on your baby mama
Sip some lean, go get a pistol, shoot out the window
Bet your favorite team, play you some Madden
Go to the club or your mama house
Whatever you doin', just make it count
(I need some water)
Wake up in the mornin'
Thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Hop in the shower, put on your makeup, lace your weave up
Touch on yourself, call up your nigga, tell him he ain't shit
Credit card scam, get you a Visa, make him pay your rent
Hop on the 'Gram, flex on the bitches that be hatin' on you
Pop you a pill, call up your bitches, have 'em waitin' on you
Go to the club, have you some fun, make that ass bounce
It's whatever, just make it count
I need some water
Somethin' came over me
Way too hot to simmer down
Might as well overheat
Too close to comfort
As blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racin' like a junkie's
I just need you to want me
Am I askin' too much?
Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that
Girl, I respect the cat
I promise just a touch
Let me put the head in
If it's okay
She said, "It's okay."
I wake in the mornin', my head spinnin' from the last night
Both in the trance, feelings I did—what a fast life!
Manager called, the lobby called, it's 11:30
Did this before, promised myself I'd be a hour early
Room full of clothes, bag full of money: call it loose change
Fumbled my jewelry, 100k, I lost a new chain
Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M
Take me a nap and do it again
We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news
Lookin' for confirmation, hopin' election wasn't true
All of us worried, all of us buried, and our feeling's deep
None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap
Still and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it
Bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly
Time passin', things change
Revertin' back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways; Lust
Lately, I feel like I been lustin' over the fame
Lately, we lust on the same routine of shame
Lately, lately, lately, my lust been hidin' (Lately)
Lately, it’s all contradiction
Lately, I’m not here
Lately, I lust over self
Lust turn into fear
Lately, in James 4:4 says
Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord
Brace yourself, lust is all yours
I need some water
Somethin' came over me
Way too high to simmer down
Might as well overheat
Too close to comfort
As blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racin' like a junkie's
I just need you to want me
Am I askin' too much?
Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that
Girl, I respect the cat
I promise just a touch
Let me put the head in
If it's okay
She said, "It's okay."
Damn
Love or lust
Damn

Sipping bubbly, feeling lovely, living lovely

Only for life, you're a homie for life
You're a homie for life, let's get it
Hit that shoulder lean, I know what comin' over mean
Backstroke oversea, I know what you need
Already on ten, our money come in
All feeling go out, this feeling don't drought
This party won't end
If I didn't ride blade on curb, would you still (love me)
If I made up my mind at work would you still (love me)
Keep it a hundred, I'd rather you trust me than to (love me)

I wanna be with you, ayy, I wanna be with
I wanna be with you, ayy, I wanna be with

I'm on the way
We ain't got no time to waste
Popping your gum on the way
Am I in the way?
I don't want to pressure you none
I want your blessing today
Oh by the way, open the door by the way
Told you that I'm on the way
I'm on the way, I know connection is vague
Pick up the phone for me babe
Dammit, we jammin'
Bad attitude for your nanny
Curvin' your hit from yo' mammy
Remember Gardena, I took the studio camera
I know Top will be mad at me
I had to do it, I want your body, your music
I bought the big one to prove it
Look what you made
Told you that I'm on the way
I'm like an exit away, yup
If didn't ride blade on curb, would you still (love me)
If I made up my mind at work would you still (love me)

America, God bless you if it's good to you
America please take my hand
Can you help me underst-
New Kung Fu Kenny
Throw a steak off the yacht
To a pool full of sharks, he'll take it
Leave him in the wilderness
With a sworn nemesis, he'll make it
Take the gratitude from him
I bet he'll show you something, woah
I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothing
I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothing
I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothing
I'll chip a nigga then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like bitch I did that x-rated
Johnny don't wanna go to school no more, no more
Johnny said books ain't cool no more (no more)
Johnny wanna be a rapper like his big cousin
Johnny caught a body yesterday out hustlin'
God bless America you know we all love him
Yesterday I got a call like from my dog like 101
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
Talkin' out his head philosphing on what the lord had done
He said, "K-Dot can you pray for me?
It's been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome"
He was lookin' for some closure
Hopin' I could bring him closer
To the spiritual, my spirit do no better, but I told him
"I can't sugar coat the answer for you
This is how I feel—if somebody kill my son
That mean somebody's gettin' killed"
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch
I wait in front a niggas spot and watch him hit his block
I'll catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all I got
I'll chip a nigga then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, "Bitch I did that"
Ain't no black power when your baby killed by a coward
I can't even keep the peace, don't you fuck with one of ours
It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird on the street, paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my momma
Touch my sister, touch my woman
Touch my daddy, touch my niece
Touch my nephew, touch my brother
You should chip a nigga then throw the blower in his lap
Matter fact, I'm 'bout to speak at this convention
Call you back
Alright kids we're gonna talk about gun control
(Pray for me)
Damn
It's not a place
This country is to be a sound of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look around
Hail Mary, Jesus and Joseph
The great American flag
Is wrapped and dragged with explosives
Compulsive disorder, sons and daughters
Barricaded blocks and borders
Look what you taught us
It's murder on my street, w'all street, back streets
Wall street, corporate offices, banks
Employees and bosses with homicidal thoughts
Donald Trump's in office, we lost Barack
And promised to never doubt him again
But is America honest or do we bask in sin?
Pass the gin, I mix it with American blood
Then bash him in, you crippin'ìg or you married to blood?
I'll ask again—oops—accident
It's nasty when you set us up
Then roll the dice, then bet us up
You overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us
Gang members or terrorists, et cetera, et cetera
Americas reflections of me
That's what a mirror does
It's not a place
This country is to be a sound of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look ar-
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth
What’s up, family? Yeah, it's yo cousin Carl, man, just givin' you a call, man. I know you been havin’ a lot on yo mind lately, and I know you feel like, you know, people ain't been prayin' for you. But you have to understand this, man, that we are a cursed people. Deuteronomy 28:28 says, "The Lord shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and astonishment of heart." See, family, that's why you feel like you feel like you got a chip on your shoulder. Until you finally get the memo, you will always feel that way…
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Pain in my heart carry burdens full of struggle
Why God, why God do I gotta bleed?
Every stone thrown at you restin' at my feet
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Earth is no more, won't you burn this muh'fucka?
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth
I beat yo ass, keep talkin’ back
I beat yo ass, who bought you that?
You stole it, I beat yo ass if you say that game is broken
I beat yo ass if you jump on my couch
I beat yo ass if you walk in this house
With tears in your eyes, runnin’ from Poo Poo and Prentice
Go back outside, I beat yo ass, lil nigga
That homework better be finished, I beat yo ass
Your teachers better not be bitchin' ’bout you in class
That pizza better not be wasted, you eat it all
That TV better not be loud if you got it on
Them Jordans better not get dirty when I just bought 'em
Better not hear 'bout you humpin' on Keisha’s daughter
Better not hear you got caught up
I beat yo ass, you better not run to your father
I beat yo ass, you know my patience runnin' thin
I got beaucoup payments to make
County building's on my ass
Tryna take my food stamps away
I beat yo ass if you tell them social workers he live here
I beat yo ass if I beat yo ass twice and you still here
Seven years old, think you run this house by yourself?
Nigga, you gon' fear me if you don't fear no one else
If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucka up
And then I'd take two puffs
I'm high now, I'm high now
I'm high now, I'm high now
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth
I'll prolly die anonymous
I'll prolly die with promises
I'll prolly die walkin' back home from the candy house
I'll prolly die because these colors are standin' out
I'll prolly die because I ain't know Demarcus was snitchin'
I'll prolly die at these house parties, fuckin' with bitches
I'll prolly die from witnesses leavin' me falsed accused
I'll prolly die from thinkin' that me and your hood was cool
Or maybe die from pressin' the line, actin' too extra
Or maybe die because these smokers
Are more than desperate
I'll prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges
Body slammed on black and white paint, my bones snappin'
Or maybe die from panic or die from bein' too lax
Or die from waitin' on it, die 'cause I'm movin' too fast
I'll prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments
I'll prolly die tryna diffuse two homies arguin'
I'll prolly die 'cause that's what you do when you're 17
All worries in a hurry, I wish I controlled things
If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucka up
And then I'd take two puffs
I've been hungry all my life
I'm high now, I'm high now
I'm high now, I'm high now
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
Now…
When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the bad girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out
And just kill somethin', drill somethin'
Get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say 'bout me reveal
If my reputation would miss me
What they see from me
Would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me
Would make 'em highlight my simplest lines
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me
So hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me
So hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
Damn
Goddamn you
Goddamn me
Goddamn us
Goddamn we
Goddamn us all
Verse two says you only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities. So until we come back to these commandments, until you come back to these commandments, we're gonna feel this way, we're gonna be under this curse. Because he said he's gonna punish us, the so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians, are the true children of Israel. We are the Israelites according to the Bible. The children of Israel, he's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience, because we chose to follow other gods that aren't his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee. So, just like you chasten your own son, he's gonna chastise you because he loves you. So that's why we get chastised, that's why we're in the position we're in. Until we come back to these laws, statutes and commandments, and do what the Lord said, these curses are gonna be upon us. We're gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live here in today, in the United States of America. I love you, son, and I pray for you. God bless you, shalom.
This what God feel like, huh, yeah
Laughin' to the bank like, "A-ha!", huh, yeah
Flex on swole like, "A-ha!", huh, yeah
You feel some type of way, then a-ha!
Huh, yeah (a-ha-ha, a-ha-ha)
Ever since a young man
All I wanted to be was a gunman
Shootin’ up the charts, better run, man
Y'all gotta see that I won, man
Slick as El DeBarge with the finger waves, work it, JT
Handle bars like a fade, watch me work it, JT
I'm at large, runnin’ plays like a circuit, JT
I'm sellin' verses, Jay Z, watch me work it, JT
Look, look… hol' up!
Don't judge me, my mama caught me with a strap
Don't judge me, I was young, fuckin' all the rats
Don't judge me, aimin’ at your head for a stack
Don’t judge me! Don't judge me!
Now my home got a Valley peak
Don’t judge me, if I press your line you a freak
Don't judge me, won't you tell a friend y'all gon’ see—
This what God feel like, huh, yeah
Laughin' to the bank like, "A-ha!", huh, yeah
Flex on swole like, "A-ha!", huh, yeah
You feel some type of way, then a-ha!
Huh, yeah (a-ha-ha, a-ha-ha)
Fuck is you talkin' to?
Aye, do you know who you talkin' to?
Slide on you like fallen drapes
God toss full of carnivals
I kill 'em with kindness
Or I kill 'em with diamonds
Or I put up like fifteen hundred
Get yo' ass killed by the finest
Everything in life is a gamble
Nothin' in life I can't handle
Seen it all, done it all, felt pain more
For the cars, I done put blood on sword
Everything I do is to embrace y'all
Everything I write is a damn eight ball
Everything I touch is a damn gold mine
Everything I say is from an angel
I don't rush shit, fuck shit
Always your shit, my shit
Cannonballs to ignite shit
Morning to the night shift
I'm on, I ain't sorry for it
Ask for a piece of mine, you charged me for it
I wanna see sometimes if you ignore it
I'm in the streets sometimes and can't afford it
I got a bad habit
Levitate, duckin' haters
Oh my! My heart is rich, my heart is famous
This what God feel like
Huh, yeah (this what God feel like)
Laughin' to the bank like, "A-ha!"
(This what God feel like)
Huh, yeah (this what God feel like)
Flex on swole like, "A-ha!"
(This what God feel like)
Huh, yeah (this what God feel like)
You feel some type of way, then a-ha!
(This what God feel like)
Huh, yeah (this what God feel like)
This what God feel like
It was always me vs the world
Until I found it's me vs me
Why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why, why?
Just remember, what happens on Earth stays on Earth!
We gon' put it in reverse
Darling, I told you many times
And I am telling you once again
Just to remind you, sweetheart
That my—
Oh Lamar, Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard
Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark
Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star
Life is one funny mothafucka
A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him
I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep
Introverted by my thoughts
Children, listen, it gets deep
See, once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects
The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect
Adaptation inevitable: gun violence, crack spot
Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
Anthony was the oldest of seven
Well-respected, calm and collected
Laughin' and jokin' made life easier
Hard times, Momma on crack
A four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her
His family history: pimpin' and bangin'
He was meant to be dangerous
Clocked him a grip and start slangin'
Fifteen, scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces
Even got some head from a smoker last weekend
Dodged a policeman, workin' for his big homie
Small-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him
10,000 dollars out of a project housing, that's on the daily
Seen his first mil twenty years old, had a couple of babies
Had a couple of shooters
Caught a murder case, fingerprints on the gun they assumin'
But witnesses couldn't prove it
That was back when he turned his back
And they killed his cousin
He beat the case and went back to hustlin'
Bird-shufflin', Anthony rang
The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang
That 5.0 thing, they say 5-0 came
Circlin' parking lots and parking spots
And hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks
Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it
He brushed them off
And walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken
See, at this chicken spot
There was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot
With a curly top and a gap in his teeth
He worked the window, his name was Ducky
He came from the streets, the Robert Taylor Homes
Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome
Drove to California with a woman on him and 500 dollars
They had a son, hopin' that he'd see college
Hustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it
Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends
Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
'Cross the street from the projects
Anthony planned to rob it
Stuck up the place before, back in '84
That's when affiliation was really eight gears of war
So many relatives tellin' us, sellin' us devilish works
Killin' us, crime, intelligent, felonious
Prevalent proposition with 9's
Ducky was well-aware
They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
He figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides
Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line
Two extra biscuits, Anthony liked him
And then let him slide; they didn't kill him
In fact, it look like they're the last to survive
Pay attention, that one decision changed both of they lives
One curse at a time
Reverse the manifest and good karma, and I'll tell you why
You take two strangers, and put 'em in random predicaments; give 'em a soul
So they can make their own choices and live with it
Twenty years later, them same strangers you make 'em meet again
Inside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits
Then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident
Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?
Because if Anthony killed Ducky
Top Dawg could be servin' life
While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight
So, I was takin' a walk the other day…
Come here girl?
Oh you want me to touch you right there?
Oh, like a little lamb, play in your hair
Oh you want it? Oh you want it right now
Like that? I got you baby
All on you baby
Push it back on daddy
Push it back on daddy baby
I seen it vividly jogging my brain memory, life is...
I seen it vividly jogging my brain memory
Life is long as infinity this was the final calling
No birds chirping or flying no dogs barking
We all nervous and crying moving in caution
In disbeliefs our beliefs reason for all this
The tallest building plummet, cracking and crumbling
The ground is shaking swallowing young woman
With a baby, daisies, and other flowers burning in destruction
The smell is disgusting the heat is unbearable
Preachers touching on boys run for cover the paranoid
Rapists and murderers hurdle alleys
Valleys and high places turn into
Das Famous screaming in agony
Atheists for suicide, planes falling out the sky
Trains jumping off the track, mothers yelling "he's alive"
Backpedaling christians settling for forgiveness
Evidence all around us the town is covered in fishes
Ocean water dried out, fire burning more tires out
Tabernacle and city capital turned inside out
Public bathroom, college classroom's been deserted
Another trumpet has sounded off and everyone heard it
(It's happening) no more running from world wars
(It's happening) no more discriminating the poor
(It's happening) no more bad bitches and real niggas
Wishing for granite gold the last taste of a lord
I swore I seen it vividly
I mine a couple from heaven that play the symphony
Thunder like number four, then I heard
"What have you did for me"
I fell to my knees, pulled out my resume
Then did it back to June 17th, 1997
My paperwork was like a receipt
I was valedictorian, I was fearful of judgment
But confident I had glory in all my past endeavors
Close my eyes pray to god that I live forever
Dark skies, fire and brimstone some of us sit home
Some of us never did wrong but still went to hell
Geez Louise I thought you said that I excel
I made To Pimp a Butterfly 'fore you told me
To use my vocals to save man-kind for you
Say I didn't try for you, say I didn't ride for you
I tied for you, I pushed the club to the side for you
Who love you like I love you?
Crucifix, tell me you can fix
Anytime I need, I'mma start jotting everything in my diary
Never would you lie to me
Always camaraderie, I can see, hard days been numbered
Revelation greatest as we hearing the last trumpet
All man, child, woman, life completely went in reverse
I guess I'm running in place trying to make it to church
Young nigga act an ass
Young nigga act a fool
Young nigga get yo' cash
Young nigga do what it do
Young nigga go, young nigga go
Young nigga go, young nigga go
Whatever makes all of you happy in this bitch
Just take it all back before the light switch
Pimp-pimp hooray
Pimp-pimp hooray
Hooray
Pimp-pimp hooray
Pimp-pimp
I'm sick and tired of being tired
I can't pick a side, the Gemini
Prophesize if we living, I
Promise momma not to feel no lie
Seen black turn 'em Burgundy
Hundred of them, I know I'm greedy
Stuck inside the belly of the beast
Can you please pray for me?
Get God on the phone
Said it won't be long
I see jiggaboos, I see Styrofoams
My hood going brazy
Where did we go wrong?
I see jiggaboos, I see Styrofoams
Get Top on the phone
Tell the squad come home
We gon' ball again 'fore he call us home
World is going brazy
Where did we go wrong?
It's a tidal wave, it's a thunderdome
Get God on the phone
I just got a raise (I just got a raise)
Spent it all on me (I spent it all on me)
Diamonds all appraised (diamonds all appraised)
And I'm bossing up (and I'm bossing up)
Bitch get out the way (bitch get out the way)
I'm the only way
We can fornicate
Ah, pimping and posing
Look what I drove in, ah
Having these hoes and I know that I'm chosen, ah
I live by the code and me and my bros and
Ah, my dollars ain't foldin', you was never the homie
Seen black turn 'em Burgundy
Hundred of them, I know I'm greedy
Stuck inside the belly of the beast
Can you please pray for me?
Get God on the phone
Said it won't be long
I see jiggaboos, I see Styrofoams
My hood going brazy
Where did we go wrong?
I see jiggaboos, I see Styrofoams
Get Top on the phone
World is going brazy
Cornrow Kenny, he was born with a vision
All morning with the mixed dashboards triple digits
Parallel park like an alien, can't visit
Slideshow for the nice show, ten bitches
God knows with a blindfold, King Kendrick
(Hello Billy)
So many plays on me I finesse
Palisade views with some sex
I lost a lot of love for missionary
This the first time I confess
Me and Top is like a Kobe and Phil
A father figure fuck with him, you get killed
Fuck with me and he will kill you himself
TDE the mafia of the west
Move in silence, yeah, we juggin' like that
Act of violence, yeah, we juggin' like that
I did a lot of dumb shit in my past
Lord forgive me, hoping I don't relapse
Dave just bought a new nine eleven
Almost thought I'd seen another plane crash
Q just bought a brand new McLaren
Rock-a-lack about to buy the projects
Moosa got his son dripping in gold
Ali 'bout to let his hair down on hoes
Me, I'm about to let my hair down on hoes
Top billing that's a million a show
Might blow the whole Remy on Soul
Might tell Obama be more like Punch
Sounwave caught a Grammy last year
Mack wop, bet he do what he want
Fuck you niggas, level two I'm not done
2Teez told me that I am the one
I can put a rapper on life support
Guarantee that's something that none of you want
Ten homies down and they all serving life
Water's like twenty-five hundred a month
What if I empty my bank out and stunt?
What if I certified all of these ones?
Bitch I get buck, I'm as real as they come
Shit is amazing, I'm feeding my cravings
You know that you want me come here now lil' baby
I'm fuckin, I'm crazy
Serving it like I belong in the basement
Alive at the Days Inn
Yay and my relative like cherry soda
Pistol and poverty, come get to know us
(Get Top on the phone)
Who doing the drums?
Man put that nigga on the drums man
Yep all day, mortal man and Kunta
Alright, from the top!

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
So I met this young lady, ya know, when I went back home. I was tryna spit my best game to her, you know, give her my best cap, but she kept on snapping her fingers like *snaps*. I said "You know what, girl? You crazy." Then she asked me what he said
[Verse: Kendrick Lamar and Anna Wise]
(What did the Asian say?)
A peace of mind
That's what the Asian said, I need a divine
Intervention was his religion and I was surprised
Him believing in Buddha, me believing in God
Asked him what are you doing, he said "taking my time"
Meditation is a must, it don't hurt if you try
See you thinking too much, plus you too full of yourself
Worried about your career, you ever think of your health?
(What did the Indian say?)
A piece of land
That's what the Indian said, I needed demand
Telling me longevity is in the dirt, should buy some property first
Should profit a better dollar with generational perks
Equity at his best, really, you should invest
These tangible things expire, don't you expect
Income with so much outcome and yes
Look at my heritage, we blessed
(Now what the black man say?)
A piece of pussy
That's what the black man said, I needed to push me
To the limit to satisfy my hunger
We do it all for a woman from hair cut to a wool
We like to live in the jungle, like to play in the peach
What you saying to me?
He said "nigga, come back to reality for a week"
Pussy is power, fuck on a new bitch every night
I wouldn't be prouder, you should allow it
(What the white man say?)
A piece of mine's
That's what the white man wanted when I rhyme
Telling me that he selling me just for $10.99
If I go platinum from rapping, I do the company fine
What if I compromise? He said it don't even matter
You make a million or more, you living better than average
You losing your core following, gaining it all
He put a price on my talent, I hit the bank and withdraw
Hit the bank and withdraw, hit the bank and withdraw
Put myself in the rocket ship and I shot for the stars
Look at what you accomplished and what he said to the boy
I'mma make you some promises that you just can't ignore
Your profession anonymous as an artist
If I don't target your market
If you ain't signing your signature when I throw you my wallet
A lot of rappers are giving their demo all in the toilet
You work toward your master's mortgage, I need a piece
[Saxophone Interlude: Terrace Martin]
[Hook: Bilal]
I holler, "What you do? What you say?"
I shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if I get freed today
I holler, "What you do? What you say?"
I shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if I get freed today
[Outro]
What the black man say?
Tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die
Tell 'em we don't die, we multiply
Tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die

[Verse: SZA (Kendrick Lamar)]
They say the government mislead the youth, youth, youth, youth
(Tell 'em when you went to the park and everybody came back and...)
And welfare don't mean well for you, you, you, you
(What about when you tried to do a side for that but you...)
They tell me that my bill's past due, due, due, due
(Talk about the charge you got...)
And preacher man don't always tell the truth, truth, truth
(Do you believe in God? If you don't, it's cool)
[Coda: SZA & Lance Skiiiwalker (Kendrick Lamar)]
(But) head is the answer, head is the future
Don't second guess yourself
(Don't tell them when you second guess yourself I need you in the kitchen now I forgot...)
Come on give me some help, yeah
Head is the answer, head is the future
Don't second guess yourself
Come on, give me some help
[Bridge: Lance Skiiiwalker]
And I just wanna
And I just wanna
Straight up
Eyes with my head
And I can't use some help
Straight up
[Outro: SZA]
Head is the future
[Hook: Anna Wise & Kendrick Lamar]
Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside away you flow
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside away you flow
And this I know
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I got 100 on my dash, got 200 in my trunk
Name in the grab bags, put my Bible in the trunk
Taaka vodka on the top of my binocular I'm drunk
How can I can make them popular, pop em' when I want
See I'm livin' with anxiety, duckin' the sobriety
Fuckin' up the system I ain't fuckin' with society
Justice ain't free, therefore justice ain't me
So I justify his name on obituary
Why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart?
Once upon a time I used to go to church and talk to God
Now I'm thinkin' to myself, hollow tips is all I got
Now I'm drinkin' by myself, at the intersection, parked
Watch you when you walk inside your house
You threw your briefcase all on the couch
I plan on creeping through your fuckin' door and blowin' out
Every piece of your brain until your son jump in your arms
Cut on the engine, then sped off in the rain
I'm gone
[Hook: Anna Wise]
Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside away you flow
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
[Verse 2: Punch & Kendrick Lamar]
Drove alone, with a bottle of his own grippin' the handle
Lit off henny, I'm tryna dismantle
These wicked ways, I've engaged in such a gamble
Cause I could speak the truth and I know the world would unravel, wait
That's a bit ambitious maybe I'm trippin'
Maybe I'm crazy, maybe I exist in a different dimension
Not to mention when I close my eyes I see the distance
It's such a scary sight so I rarely go to sleep at night
I watch the sun rise then I watch the sun fall
Studied the son of God but still don't recognize my flaws
I guess I'm lost, the cost of being successful is equal to being neglectful
I pray my experience helps you
As for me I'm tryna sort it out
Searching for loopholes in my bruised soul
But who knows?
I just need a little space to breathe
I know perception is key, so I am king
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar and Jay Rock]
The other side has never mortified my mortal mind
The borderline between insanity is father time
I fall behind my skeleton, they tell me that I'm blind
I know that I'm intelligence, my confidence just died
Carpe diem, seize the day, I can't compromise
A tape worm couldn't cure this gluttonous appetite
A couple trinkets, they seein me as I pacify
But couldn't fathom the meaning of seein' sacrifice
I'm passin' lives on a daily, maybe I'm losing faith
Genocism and capitalism just made me hate
Correctionals and these private prisons gave me a date
Professional dream killers reason why I'm awake
I'm sleep walkin', I'm street stalkin', I'm outta place
Reinforcing this heat barking, these are the brakes
Before I blink do I see me before them pearly gates?
Or this is just a mirage or a facade
Wait
These metamorphic supernatural forces dominate what I see
A Gemini, do I let these personalities always conflict in me
Oh! But don't be scared of me, girl
I can't explain
I know it's foreign to you
I know it's hard to believe
God give me the favor
I can explain
More than a compliment
And I could use some assistance, let me show you
I can explain
Or should I know? I spend about two times
I'll be there with the answer
Let me explain
I reside
I want God
Both sides of me are evenly odd
It's attractive
You're intrigued
Am I mortal man or make believe?
Anything you want
I can explain
Any misunderstandings, baby
Let me explain
Why don't you sit and talk to me?
Let me explain it
Let me explain
My mama told me that I was different the moment I was invented
Estranged baby, no I'm not ashamed
I recommend every inch of your lunatic ways
Praise the lord, you teach the kids how to be themselves and plenty more
You know the male species can be redundant
I mean we love a woman and think we can satisfy her
Between sheets, covers and pillows
I'm promising your lack of tolerance stuck on a 0
I'm promising that I'm acknowledging you as my hero
Cause you believe in me
No you're not easily impressed
But I possess qualities that you need to see
Look at my flaws, look at my flaws
Look at my imperfections and all
Look how you think that my mystique is a round of applause
And yours equally valued
You stick out like an alien compared to those around you
And that's alright because I like it
You and me are the same
Hopefully I'm invited, hopefully you don't change
Because I know for sure who you are
ì
I can explain
Your mama raised you, your daddy raised you
Hand washing your clothes on Sunday
Let me explain
Walking your brother to school, three miles away
To feed him knowledge
I can explain
Don't you explain that, don't you explain the reason why your mind can travel
Let me explain
I wanna know what you think
I wanna pick your brain when I see you
But don't you ever
Let me explain
Or should I know?
I spin around two times, a blessing in disguise
I can explain
I know for sure who you are
You're the goddess of the eye
I am yours
I can explain
I am yours
I am yours
I am yours
I am yours
Yours
Yours...

Part II
Yeah, yeah
Young Egypt
Look, look
I feel like Pacino in Godfather, I'm charged
Our father who art in Heaven, Kendrick at large
Came in the game with a plan of beatin' the odds
What an accomplishment, broken promises
Kept my focus anonymous till I dealt with the consequence
The greatest and latest mogul, you know what time it is
You niggas fear me like y'all fear God
You sound frantic, I hear panic in your voice
Just know the mechanics of making your choice and writin' your bars
Before you poke out your chest, loosen your bra
Before you step out of line and dance with the star
I could never end a career if it never start
The murderous capital, avenues lookin' like evil dead zombies
With batteries to the head
The flattery of watchin' my stock rise
The salary, the compensation tripled my cock size
I run through these stop signs with no brake fluid
Just premium gas, do it for dolo
Crash markets and prejudiced tags, look at my photo
Black excellence, pessimist died countin' my coin
Hope it's evident that I inspired a thousand emcees to do better
I blew cheddar on youth centers, buildings and Bimmers and blue leather
Forecasted my future, this is the future
The mastermind until my next album, more power to you

This is a fifteen minute song
We're just jammin' out, we on stage

Hundred thousand
Hundred thousand, you gotta see it!
Look, look, look, go back to the down note
They all sing this shit, everybody
[Verse 1]
Now I don't let you down, and for
You see, you see, you see, you see
But I don't shake you down, dog for you, you, you, you
They say the government ain't the truth, truth, truth, truth
And the politicians always mislead the youth, youth, youth, youth

But head is the answer
Head is the future
Don't second guess yourself
Come on, give me some help
Hey one more time, band, I need y'all to help me out right now

Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey
[Verse 1]
Two tears in the bucket I cry with you
But I could never lie with you
I could never afford not to afford
I could never put my plans to the side with you
I could never see a red light
Like a deer with a headlight
I freeze up when I re-up
See I barely have patience
And you're relating
Only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it?
The reason I never went to work for it
See a nine to five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came that check didn’t hurt me
You plead the fifth
I read the Fifth Amendment
We both criminals with bad intentions
They say time heals all
But if I can shortcut
My success, Corvettes by tomorrow
[Hook]
Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey
[Verse 2]
My home girl got a credit card scam
She got a scholarship to college but she don’t give a damn
Intuition she got a broke bitch wishin'
She tell me this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
I know you, woman, I console you, woman
You feel like the universe owes you, woman
Oh the anticipation, of hoping you could make it
Bitches don't prosper chasing education
But you're talented, and can't handle it
And your homegirls can't be your manager
365 times four, plus more
If yan't get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina?
But shit, ain't no money like fast money
Even today I'm considered a crash dummy
A rapper chasing stardom, how can I fast forward?
My accolades better than all them
[Hook]
Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey
[Verse 3]
I wrote this song looking at a broke home baby
You know the poverty stricken the little broke boy and babies
Somebody yell "Kendrick American, they sho’ is crazy"
And I said “why?”
Then he looked me in the eye, and said "nigga you fucked up"
You’re banking on good luck, you wishing for miracles
You never been through shit, you’re crying hysterical
You settle for everything, complain about everything
You say you sold crack, my world amphetamine
Your projects ain’t shit, I live in a hut bitch
I'm living to keep warm, you living to pay rent
I paid my way through by waiting on Allah
You played your way through, by living in sci-fi
Bullshitting yourself, you talking to strangers
Same thing goes for the ones you came with
When y'all came on the boat looking for hope
And all you can say is that you’re looking for dope
These days ain’t no compromise
And your pain ain’t mines half the time
A brand new excuse ain’t shit to me
Bitch I made my moves, with shackled feet
Cape Town
[Interlude]
In today's day and age we practice the self pity of taking the easy way out
You wait on them, him and her
But when a blessing takes long, that's when you go wrong
You selfish motherfucker
[Hook]
Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey
[Outro]
Pimp pimp hooray
Come here girl?
Oh you want me to touch you right there?
Oh, like a little lamb, play in your hair
Oh you want it? Oh you want it right now
Like that? I got you baby
All on you baby
Push it back on daddy
Push it back on daddy baby
I seen it vividly jogging my brain memory, life is...
I seen it vividly jogging my brain memory
Life is long as infinity this was the final calling
No birds chirping or flying no dogs barking
We all nervous and crying moving in caution
In disbeliefs our beliefs reason for all this
The tallest building plummet, cracking and crumbling
The ground is shaking swallowing young woman
With a baby, daisies, and other flowers burning in destruction
The smell is disgusting the heat is unbearable
Preachers touching on boys run for cover the paranoid
Rapists and murderers hurdle alleys
Valleys and high places turn into
Das Famous screaming in agony
Atheists for suicide, planes falling out the sky
Trains jumping off the track, mothers yelling "he's alive"
Backpedaling christians settling for forgiveness
Evidence all around us the town is covered in fishes
Ocean water dried out, fire burning more tires out
Tabernacle and city capital turned inside out
Public bathroom, college classroom's been deserted
Another trumpet has sounded off and everyone heard it
(It's happening) no more running from world wars
(It's happening) no more discriminating the poor
(It's happening) no more bad bitches and real niggas
Wishing for granite gold the last taste of a lord
I swore I seen it vividly
I mine a couple from heaven that play the symphony
Thunder like number four, then I heard
"What have you did for me"
I fell to my knees, pulled out my resume
Then did it back to June 17th, 1997
My paperwork was like a receipt
I was valedictorian, I was fearful of judgment
But confident I had glory in all my past endeavors
Close my eyes pray to god that I live forever
Dark skies, fire and brimstone some of us sit home
Some of us never did wrong but still went to hell
Geez Louise I thought you said that I excel
I made To Pimp a Butterfly 'fore you told me
To use my vocals to save man-kind for you
Say I didn't try for you, say I didn't ride for you
I tied for you, I pushed the club to the side for you
Who love you like I love you?
Crucifix, tell me you can fix
Anytime I need, I'mma start jotting everything in my diary
Never would you lie to me
Always camaraderie, I can see, hard days been numbered
Revelation greatest as we hearing the last trumpet
All man, child, woman, life completely went in reverse
I guess I'm running in place trying to make it to church
Young nigga act an ass
Young nigga act a fool
Young nigga get yo' cash
Young nigga do what it do
Young nigga go, young nigga go
Young nigga go, young nigga go
Whatever makes all of you happy in this bitch
Just take it all back before the light switch
Pimp-pimp hooray
Pimp-pimp hooray
Hooray
Pimp-pimp hooray
Pimp-pimp
I'm sick and tired of being tired
I can't pick a side, the Gemini
Prophesize if we living, I
Promise momma not to feel no lie

Hundred of them, I know I'm greedy
Stuck inside the belly of the beast

It's a tidal wave, it's a thunderdome
Get God on the phone

Spent it all on me (I spent it all on me)
Diamonds all appraised (diamonds all appraised)
And I'm bossing up (and I'm bossing up)

I'm the only way
We can fornicate
Ah, pimping and posing

All morning with the mixed dashboards triple digits
Parallel park like an alien, can't visit
Slideshow for the nice show, ten bitches
God knows with a blindfold, King Kendrick
(Hello Billy)
So many plays on me I finesse
Palisade views with some sex
I lost a lot of love for missionary
This the first time I confess
Me and Top is like a Kobe and Phil
A father figure fuck with him, you get killed
Fuck with me and he will kill you himself
TDE the mafia of the west
Move in silence, yeah, we juggin' like that
Act of violence, yeah, we juggin' like that
I did a lot of dumb shit in my past
Lord forgive me, hoping I don't relapse
Dave just bought a new nine eleven
Almost thought I'd seen another plane crash
Q just bought a brand new McLaren
Rock-a-lack about to buy the projects
Moosa got his son dripping in gold
Ali 'bout to let his hair down on hoes
Me, I'm about to let my hair down on hoes
Top billing that's a million a show
Might blow the whole Remy on Soul
Might tell Obama be more like Punch
Sounwave caught a Grammy last year
Mack wop, bet he do what he want
Fuck you niggas, level two I'm not done
2Teez told me that I am the one
I can put a rapper on life support
Guarantee that's something that none of you want
Ten homies down and they all serving life
Water's like twenty-five hundred a month
What if I empty my bank out and stunt?
What if I certified all of these ones?
Bitch I get buck, I'm as real as they come
Shit is amazing, I'm feeding my cravings
You know that you want me come here now lil' baby
I'm fuckin, I'm crazy
Serving it like I belong in the basement
Alive at the Days Inn
Yay and my relative like cherry soda
Pistol and poverty, come get to know us

Man put that nigga on the drums man
Yep all day, mortal man and Kunta
Alright, from the top!

So I met this young lady, ya know, when I went back home. I was tryna spit my best game to her, you know, give her my best cap, but she kept on snapping her fingers like *snaps*. I said "You know what, girl? You crazy." Then she asked me what he said
[Verse: Kendrick Lamar and Anna Wise]
(What did the Asian say?)
A peace of mind
That's what the Asian said, I need a divine
Intervention was his religion and I was surprised
Him believing in Buddha, me believing in God
Asked him what are you doing, he said "taking my time"
Meditation is a must, it don't hurt if you try
See you thinking too much, plus you too full of yourself
Worried about your career, you ever think of your health?
(What did the Indian say?)
A piece of land
That's what the Indian said, I needed demand
Telling me longevity is in the dirt, should buy some property first
Should profit a better dollar with generational perks
Equity at his best, really, you should invest
These tangible things expire, don't you expect
Income with so much outcome and yes
Look at my heritage, we blessed
(Now what the black man say?)
A piece of pussy
That's what the black man said, I needed to push me
To the limit to satisfy my hunger
We do it all for a woman from hair cut to a wool
We like to live in the jungle, like to play in the peach
What you saying to me?
He said "nigga, come back to reality for a week"
Pussy is power, fuck on a new bitch every night
I wouldn't be prouder, you should allow it
(What the white man say?)
A piece of mine's
That's what the white man wanted when I rhyme
Telling me that he selling me just for $10.99
If I go platinum from rapping, I do the company fine
What if I compromise? He said it don't even matter
You make a million or more, you living better than average
You losing your core following, gaining it all
He put a price on my talent, I hit the bank and withdraw
Hit the bank and withdraw, hit the bank and withdraw
Put myself in the rocket ship and I shot for the stars
Look at what you accomplished and what he said to the boy
I'mma make you some promises that you just can't ignore
Your profession anonymous as an artist
If I don't target your market
If you ain't signing your signature when I throw you my wallet
A lot of rappers are giving their demo all in the toilet
You work toward your master's mortgage, I need a piece
[Saxophone Interlude: Terrace Martin]
[Hook: Bilal]
I holler, "What you do? What you say?"
I shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if I get freed today
I holler, "What you do? What you say?"

What the black man say?
Tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die
Tell 'em we don't die, we multiply
Tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die

How can I can make them popular, pop em' when I want
See I'm livin' with anxiety, duckin' the sobriety
Fuckin' up the system I ain't fuckin' with society

Once upon a time I used to go to church and talk to God
Now I'm thinkin' to myself, hollow tips is all I got
Now I'm drinkin' by myself, at the intersection, parked
Watch you when you walk inside your house
You threw your briefcase all on the couch
I plan on creeping through your fuckin' door and blowin' out
Every piece of your brain until your son jump in your arms
Cut on the engine, then sped off in the rain
I'm gone
[Hook: Anna Wise]
Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside away you flow
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
[Verse 2: Punch & Kendrick Lamar]
Drove alone, with a bottle of his own grippin' the handle
Lit off henny, I'm tryna dismantle
These wicked ways, I've engaged in such a gamble
Cause I could speak the truth and I know the world would unravel, wait
That's a bit ambitious maybe I'm trippin'
Maybe I'm crazy, maybe I exist in a different dimension
Not to mention when I close my eyes I see the distance
It's such a scary sight so I rarely go to sleep at night
I watch the sun rise then I watch the sun fall
Studied the son of God but still don't recognize my flaws
I guess I'm lost, the cost of being successful is equal to being neglectful
I pray my experience helps you
As for me I'm tryna sort it out
Searching for loopholes in my bruised soul
But who knows?
I just need a little space to breathe
I know perception is key, so I am king
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar and Jay Rock]
The other side has never mortified my mortal mind
The borderline between insanity is father time
I fall behind my skeleton, they tell me that I'm blind
I know that I'm intelligence, my confidence just died
Carpe diem, seize the day, I can't compromise
A tape worm couldn't cure this gluttonous appetite
A couple trinkets, they seein me as I pacify
But couldn't fathom the meaning of seein' sacrifice
I'm passin' lives on a daily, maybe I'm losing faith
Genocism and capitalism just made me hate
Correctionals and these private prisons gave me a date
Professional dream killers reason why I'm awake
I'm sleep walkin', I'm street stalkin', I'm outta place
Reinforcing this heat barking, these are the brakes
Before I blink do I see me before them pearly gates?
Or this is just a mirage or a facade
Wait
These metamorphic supernatural forces dominate what I see
A Gemini, do I let these personalities always conflict in me
Oh! But don't be scared of me, girl
I can't explain
I know it's foreign to you
I know it's hard to believe
God give me the favor
I can explain
More than a compliment
And I could use some assistance, let me show you
I can explain
Or should I know? I spend about two times
I'll be there with the answer
Let me explain
I reside
I want God
Both sides of me are evenly odd
It's attractive
You're intrigued
Am I mortal man or make believe?
Anything you want
I can explain
Any misunderstandings, baby
Let me explain
Why don't you sit and talk to me?
Let me explain it
Let me explain
My mama told me that I was different the moment I was invented
Estranged baby, no I'm not ashamed
I recommend every inch of your lunatic ways
Praise the lord, you teach the kids how to be themselves and plenty more
You know the male species can be redundant
I mean we love a woman and think we can satisfy her
Between sheets, covers and pillows
I'm promising your lack of tolerance stuck on a 0
I'm promising that I'm acknowledging you as my hero
Cause you believe in me
No you're not easily impressed
But I possess qualities that you need to see
Look at my flaws, look at my flaws
Look at my imperfections and all
Look how you think that my mystique is a round of applause
And yours equally valued
You stick out like an alien compared to those around you
And that's alright because I like it
You and me are the same
Hopefully I'm invited, hopefully you don't change
Because I know for sure who you are
ì
I can explain
Your mama raised you, your daddy raised you
Hand washing your clothes on Sunday
Let me explain
Walking your brother to school, three miles away
To feed him knowledge
I can explain
Don't you explain that, don't you explain the reason why your mind can travel
Let me explain
I wanna know what you think
I wanna pick your brain when I see you
But don't you ever
Let me explain
Or should I know?
I spin around two times, a blessing in disguise
I can explain
I know for sure who you are
You're the goddess of the eye
I am yours
I can explain
I am yours
I am yours
I am yours
I am yours
Yours
Yours...

Compton is where I'm from
Is where I'm from, where is I'm from
Part II
Yeah, yeah
Young Egypt
Look, look
I feel like Pacino in Godfather, I'm charged
Our father who art in Heaven, Kendrick at large
Came in the game with a plan of beatin' the odds
What an accomplishment, broken promises
Kept my focus anonymous till I dealt with the consequence
The greatest and latest mogul, you know what time it is
You niggas fear me like y'all fear God
You sound frantic, I hear panic in your voice
Just know the mechanics of making your choice and writin' your bars
Before you poke out your chest, loosen your bra
Before you step out of line and dance with the star
I could never end a career if it never start
The murderous capital, avenues lookin' like evil dead zombies
With batteries to the head
The flattery of watchin' my stock rise
The salary, the compensation tripled my cock size
I run through these stop signs with no brake fluid
Just premium gas, do it for dolo
Crash markets and prejudiced tags, look at my photo
Black excellence, pessimist died countin' my coin
Hope it's evident that I inspired a thousand emcees to do better
I blew cheddar on youth centers, buildings and Bimmers and blue leather
Forecasted my future, this is the future
The mastermind until my next album, more power to you
Gunshots
Part III
[Intro]
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on
[Interlude]
This is a fifteen minute song
We're just jammin' out, we on stage
Taz, we just jammin' out
Hundred thousand
Hundred thousand, you gotta see it!
Look, look, look, go back to the down note
They all sing this shit, everybody
[Verse 1]
Now I don't let you down, and for
You see, you see, you see, you see
But I don't shake you down, dog for you, you, you, you
They say the government ain't the truth, truth, truth, truth
And the politicians always mislead the youth, youth, youth, youth
[Hook]
But head is the answer
Head is the future
Don't second guess yourself
Come on, give me some help
Hey one more time, band, I need y'all to help me out right now
Head is the answer
Head is the future, it's the future, that nigga said
Don't second guess yourself
Come on, give me some help
Say come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, my background singer
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
[Verse 2]
I said, girl you make me wanna uh
The ho screaming now
I said baby you make..
You make me wanna just AHHH!
Baby you got me speechless right now
Laughs
I gotta take it there, I ain't even playin' no more
Said you just make me wanna Drake you down
To the ground, to the ground ground
Like bam, bam, bam, bam, bam
You just make me wanna Drake you down
Down, around like bam, bam, bam, bam, bam
And baby if your mama's around, if your mama's around
If your mama's around, if your mama's around
Tell her, tell her
No discrimination, she's young nigga chasin'
And she can get this dick too!
[Outro]
I said come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Yeah, nigga
You gotta do it, man
We gonna lay that shit
We gonna lay that shit, and watch what it's gon' do

Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey
[Verse 1]
Two tears in the bucket I cry with you
But I could never lie with you
I could never afford not to afford
I could never put my plans to the side with you
I could never see a red light
Like a deer with a headlight
I freeze up when I re-up
See I barely have patience
And you're relating
Only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it?
The reason I never went to work for it
See a nine to five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came that check didn’t hurt me
You plead the fifth
I read the Fifth Amendment
We both criminals with bad intentions
They say time heals all
But if I can shortcut
My success, Corvettes by tomorrow
[Hook]
Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey
[Verse 2]
My home girl got a credit card scam
She got a scholarship to college but she don’t give a damn
Intuition she got a broke bitch wishin'
She tell me this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
I know you, woman, I console you, woman
You feel like the universe owes you, woman
Oh the anticipation, of hoping you could make it
Bitches don't prosper chasing education
But you're talented, and can't handle it
And your homegirls can't be your manager
365 times four, plus more
If yan't get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina?
But shit, ain't no money like fast money
Even today I'm considered a crash dummy
A rapper chasing stardom, how can I fast forward?
My accolades better than all them
[Hook]
Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey
[Verse 3]
I wrote this song looking at a broke home baby
You know the poverty stricken the little broke boy and babies
Somebody yell "Kendrick American, they sho’ is crazy"
And I said “why?”
Then he looked me in the eye, and said "nigga you fucked up"
You’re banking on good luck, you wishing for miracles
You never been through shit, you’re crying hysterical
You settle for everything, complain about everything
You say you sold crack, my world amphetamine
Your projects ain’t shit, I live in a hut bitch
I'm living to keep warm, you living to pay rent
I paid my way through by waiting on Allah
You played your way through, by living in sci-fi
Bullshitting yourself, you talking to strangers
Same thing goes for the ones you came with
When y'all came on the boat looking for hope
And all you can say is that you’re looking for dope
These days ain’t no compromise
And your pain ain’t mines half the time
A brand new excuse ain’t shit to me
Bitch I made my moves, with shackled feet
Cape Town
[Interlude]
In today's day and age we practice the self pity of taking the easy way out
You wait on them, him and her
But when a blessing takes long, that's when you go wrong
You selfish motherfucker
[Hook]
Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey
[Outro]
Pimp pimp hooray
Every nigger is a star
Every nigger is a star
Every nigger is a star
Every nigger is a star
Hit me!
When the four corners of this cocoon collide
You'll slip through the cracks hoping that you'll survive
Gather your wind, take a deep look inside
Are you really who they idolize?
To pimp a butterfly
At first, I did love you
But now I just wanna fuck
Late night thinkin' of you
Until I got my nut
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board
Destroyed, but what for?
When I get signed, homie I'mma act a fool
Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room
Snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies
Blue eyed devil with a fat ass smokey
I'mma buy a brand new Caddy on fours
Trunk the hood up, two times, deuce four
Platinum on everything, platinum on wedding ring
Married to the game, made a bad bitch yours
When I get signed homie I'mma buy a strap
Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap
Take a few M-16s to the hood
Pass 'em all out on the block, what's good?
I'mma put the Compton swap meet by the White House
Republican, run up, get socked out
Hit the press with a Cuban link on my neck
Uneducated but I got a million dollar check, like that
We should never gave, we should never gave
Niggas money go back home, money go back home
We should never gave, we should never gave
Niggas money go back home, money go back home
At first, I did love you
But now I just wanna fuck
Late night thinkin' of you
Until I got my nut
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board
Destroyed, but what for?
Yo what's up? It's Dre
Remember the first time you came out to the house?
You said you wanted a spot like mine
But remember, anybody can get it
The hard part is keeping it, motherfucker
What you want you? A house or a car?
Forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anything, see, my name is Uncle Sam on your dollar
Motherfucker you can live at the mall
I know your kind (That's why I'm kind)
Don't have receipts (Oh man, that's fine)
Pay me later, wear those gators
Cliche and say, fuck your haters
I can see the borrow in you
I can see the dollar in you
Little white lies with a snow white collar in you
But it's whatever though because I'm still followin' you
Because you make me feel forever baby, count it all together baby
Then hit the register and make me feel better baby
Your horoscope is a gemini, two sides
So you better cop everything two times
Two coupes, two chains, two c-notes
Too much and enough both we know
Christmas, tell 'em what's on your wish list
Get it all, you deserve it Kendrick
And when you get the White House, do you
But remember, you ain't pass economics in school
And everything you buy, taxes will deny
I'll Wesley Snipe your ass before thirty-five
Lookin' down is quite a drop (It's quite a drop, drop)
Lookin' good when you're on top (When you're on top you got it)
A lot of metaphors, leavin' miracles metaphysically in a state of euphoria
Look both ways before you cross my mind
We should never gave, we should never gave
Niggas money go back home, money go back home
Tax man comin'
Tax man comin'
Tax man comin'
Tax man comin'
Tax man comin'
Fuck you, motherfucker, you a ho-ass nigga
I don't know why you trying to go big, nigga you ain't shit
Walking around like you God's gift to Earth, nigga you ain't shit
You ain't even buy me no outfit for the fourth
I need that Brazilian, wavy, twenty eight inch, you playin'
I shouldn't be fuckin' with you anyway, I need a baller ass, boss ass nigga
You'se a off brand ass nigga, everybody know it, your homies know it, everybody fuckin' know
Fuck you nigga, don't call me no more
You won't know, you gonna lose on the good bitch
My other nigga is on, you off
What the fuck is really going on?
This dick ain't free
You lookin' at me like it ain't a receipt
Like I never made end's meet, eatin' your leftovers and raw meat
This dick ain't free
Livin' in captivity raised my cap salary
Celery, tellin' me green is all I need
Evidently all I seen was spam and raw sardines
This dick ain't free, I mean, baby
You really think we could make a baby named Mercedes without a Mercedes Benz and twenty four inch rims, five percent tint, and air conditioning vents
Hell fuckin' naw, this dick ain't free
I need forty acres and a mule
Not a forty ounce and a pitbull
Bullshit, matador, matador, had the door knockin', whose that?
Genital's best friend, this dick ain't free
Pity the fool that made the pretty in you prosper
Titty juice and pussy lips kept me obnoxious, kept me up watchin'
Pornos and poverty, apology? No
Watch you volunteer it it while people less fortunate, like myself
Every dog has it's day, now doggy style shall help
This dick ain't free
Matter fact it need interest, matter fact it's nine inches
Matter fact see our friendship based on business
Pension, more pension, you're pinchin', my consensus
Been relentless, fuck forgiveness, fuck your feelings
Fuck your sources, all distortion, if you fuck it's more abortion
More divorce court and portion
My check with less endorsement left me dormant
Dusted, doomed, disgusted, forced with
Fuck you think is bullshit, porcelain pipes pressure, bust 'em twice
Choice is deaf, a state of decapitated the horseman
Oh America, you bad bitch, I the picked cotton that made you rich
Now my dick ain't free
I'mma get my Uncle Sam to fuck you up
You ain't no king

[Intro]
I got a bone to pick
I don't want you monkey mouth motherfuckers sittin' in
my throne again
(Aye aye nigga whats happenin' nigga, K-Dot back in
the hood nigga)
I'm mad (He mad), but I ain't stressin'
True friends, one question
[Hook]
Bitch where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin', King
Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, Kunta
Black man taking no losses
Bitch where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin', King
Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
[Verse 1]
When you got the yams (What's the yams?)
The yam is the power that be
You can smell it when I'm walking down the street
(Oh yes we can, oh yes we can)
I can dig rapping
But a rapper with a ghost writer? What the fuck
happened?
(Oh no) I swore I wouldn't tell
But most of y'all sharing bars like you got the bottom
bunk in a two man cell (A two man cell?)
Something's in the water (Something's in the water)
And if I gotta brown nose for some gold
Then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
When you got the yams (What's the yams?)
The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor
Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires
24/7, 365 days times two
I was contemplatin' gettin' on stage just to go back to
the hood, see my enemy and say...
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
(You goat mouth mammy fucker)
I was gonna kill a couple rappers but they did it to
themselves
Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin'
"Compton!"
I should probably run for Mayor when I'm done, to be
honest
And I put that on my Mama and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo woo!
Ah yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past 25 and there I was
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin' "Annie are you okay? Annie are you okay?"
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king
[Hook 2]
Bitch where was you when I was-
*POP*
(By the time you hear the next pop, the funk shall be
within you)
*POP*
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin', King
Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, (King) Kunta
Black man taking no losses
Bitch where was you when I was walkin'
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin', King
Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
What money got to do with it
When I don't know the full definition of a rap image?
I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I keep runnin' back for a visit
Hol' up, get it back
I said I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I could still kill me a nigga, so what?
[Interlude: Anna Wise]
If I was the president
I'd pay my mama's rent
Free my homies and them
Bulletproof my Chevy doors
Lay in the White House and get high, Lord
Who ever thought?
Master take the chains off me
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Life can be like a box of chocolate
Quid pro quo, somethin' for somethin', that's the obvious
Oh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it
Bitin' my style, you're salmonella poison positive
I can just alleviate the rap industry politics
Milk the game up, never lactose intolerant
The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious
Me scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges
Be all you can be, true, but the problem is
A dream's only a dream if work don't follow it
Remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this
I'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm probably just way too loyal
K Dizzle would do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god
Truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually you're never charged
But somethin' came over you once I took you to the fuckin' BET Awards
You lookin' at artists like the harvests
So many Rollies around you and you want all of them
Somebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry
I should've listened what my grandmama said to me
[Hook: Bilal]
Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass
Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga
Oh now, slow down
[Bridge: Snoop Dogg]
And once upon a time in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was 5 foot something, God bless the kid
Took his homie to the show and this is what they said
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Fuck am I s'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks?
The constant big money talk about mansions and foreign whips
The private jets and passports, presidential glass floor
Gold bottles, gold models, sniffin' up the ass for
Instagram flicks, suck a dick, fuck is this?
One more suck away from wavin' flashy wrist
My defense mechanism tell me to get him, quickly because he got it
It's the recession, then why the fuck he in King of Diamonds?
No more livin' poor, meet my .44
When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor
Now Kendrick, know they're your co-workers
But it's gon' take a lot for this pistol go cold turkey
Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay
But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA
Remember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor?
Well that's me at these awards
I guess my grandmama was warnin' a boy
She said...
[Hook]
[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
And once upon a time in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was 5 foot something, dazed and confused
Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse
You can take your boy out the hood but you can't take the hood out the homie
Took his show money, stashed it in the mozey wozey
Hollywood's nervous
Fuck you, goodnight, thank you much for your service

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence
Sometimes, I did the same
*Sound of a woman moaning*
If these walls could talk (x6)
Sex
[Bridge: Anna Wise]
She just want to close her eyes and sway
If you, if you, if you exercise your right to work it out
It's true, it's true, it's true, shout out to the birthday girls say hey
Say hey, everyone deserves a night to play
And she plays only when you tell her no
[Hook: Anna Wise (Bilal)]
If these walls could talk
(I can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you)
If these walls could talk
(I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it)
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
If these walls could talk they’d tell me to swim good
No boat I float better than he would
No life jacket I’m not the guard in Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Wall telling me they full of pain, resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me? I’m just a tenant
Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated
I interrogated every nook and cranny
I mean its still amazing before they couldn’t stand me
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when I’m here
These walls never could hold up
Everytime I come around demolition might crush
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
If these walls could talk they’d tell me to go deep
Yelling at me continuously I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down that’s my religion
Walls feeling like they ready to close in
I suffocate then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I don’t know how long I can wait in these walls
I’ve been on these streets too long looking at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song about how they walls are always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I must’ve missed them
I’m not involved I’d rather diss them
I’d rather call all you put your wall up
Cause when I come around demolition gon’ crush
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
If your walls could talk they’d tell you it’s too late
Your destiny accepted your fate
Burn accessories and stash them where they are
Take the recipe, the bible and god
Wall telling you that commissary is low
Race wars happening no calling CO
No calling your mother to save you
Homies to say you're reputable, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy Da Bull like a killer that turned snitch
Walls is telling me you a bitch
You pray for appeals hoping the warden could afford them
That sentence so important
Walls telling you to listen to "Sing About Me"
Retaliation is strong you even dream about me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted the same night
So when you play this song rewind the first verse
About me abusing my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hours of the morning
About her baby daddy currently serving life
And how she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
And how she fucking on a famous rapper
Walls could talk
[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in a hotel room

[Hook x10]
Loving you is complicated
[Verse 1]
I place blame on you still
Place shame on you still
Feel like you ain't shit
Feel like you don't feel, confidence in yourself
Breakin' on marble floors
Watchin' anonymous strangers tellin' me that I'm yours
But you ain't shit I'm convinced your talent's nothin' special
What can I blame you for
Nigga I can name several
Situation had stopped with your little sister bakin'
A baby inside, just a teenager, where's your patience?
Where's your antennas, where is the influence you speak of?
You preached in front of 100,000 but never reached her
I fuckin' tell you, you fuckin' failure you ain't no leader
I never liked you, forever despise you I don't need you
The world don't need you, don't let them deceive you
Numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, thats for dedication
Thought money would change you, made you more complacent
I fuckin' hate you, I hope you embrace it
I swear
[Hook]
[Bridge]
Lovin' you, lovin' you, not lovin' you, one hundred proof
I can feel you vibin', recognize that your ashamed of me
Yes I hate you too
[Skit]
House keeping
*knocks*
House keeping
¡Abre la puerta! ¡Abre la puerta tengo que limpiar el cuarto!
¡Es que no hay mucho tiempo tengo que limpiar el cuarto¡
!Disculpe!
[Verse 2]
You the reason why mama and them leavin'
No you ain't shit, you say you love them, I know you don't mean it
I know you're irresponsible, selfish, in denial, can't help it
Your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it
Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out
You was deserted, where was your antennas again?
Where was your presence, where was your support that you pretend?
You ain’t no brother, you ain’t no disciple, you ain’t no friend
A friend never leave Compton for profit or leave his best friend
Little brother, you promised you’d watch him before they shot him
Where was your antennas, on the road, bottles and bitches
You faced time the one time, that's unforgiven
You even Facetimed instead of a hospital visit
You should thought he would recover, well
Third surgery couldn't stop the bleeding for real
Then he died, God himself will say "you fuckin' failed"
You ain't try
[Verse 3]
I know your secrets nigga
Mood swings is frequent nigga
I know depression is restin' on your heart for two reasons nigga
I know you and a couple block boys ain't been speakin' nigga
Y'all damn near beefin', I seen it and you're the reason nigga
And if this bottle could talk *gulp* I cry myself to sleep
Bitch everything is your fault
Faults breakin' to pieces, earthquakes on every weekend
Because you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed
I know your secrets
Don't let me tell them to the world about that shit you thinkin'
And that time you *gulp* I'm bout to hurl
I'm fucked up, but I'm not as fucked up as you
You just can't get right, I think your heart made of bullet proof
Shoulda killed yo ass a long time ago
You shoulda filled that black revolver blast a long time ago
And if those mirrors could talk it would say "you gotta go"
And if I told your secrets
The world'll know money can't stop a suicidal weakness
Alls my life I has to fight, nigga
Alls my life I
Hard times like God
Bad trips like: "God!"
Nazareth, I'm fucked up
Homie you fucked up
But if God got us we then gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Uh, and when I wake up
I recognize you're lookin' at me for the pay cut
Behind my side we lookin' at you from the face down
What mac-11 even boom with the bass down
Schemin'! And let me tell you bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
What pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my mama I love her but this what I like
Lord knows, 20 of 'em in my Chevy
Tell 'em all to come and get me, reapin' everything I sow
So my karma come and Heaven no preliminary hearing
So my record and my motherfucking gang can stand in silence for the record
Tell the world I know it's too late
The hoes, the girls think I gone crazy
Try and fight my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say
When you know, we been hurt, been down before, nigga
When my pride was low, lookin' at the world like, "where do we go, nigga?"
And we hate Popo, wanna kill us dead in the street for sure, nigga
I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak and my gun might blow but we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
What you want, a house or a car
40 acres and a mule, a piano a guitar
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
Motherfucker you can live with them all
I can see the evil, I can tell it I know when it's illegal
I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero
Thinkin' of my partner put the candy, paint it on the regal
Diggin' in my pocket ain't a profit, big enough to feed you
Everyday my logic, get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico ah!
I don't talk about it, be about it, everyday I see cool
If I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you
Pet dog, pet dog, pet dog, my dog that's all
Pick back and chat I shut the back for y'all
I rap, I'm black, on track and rest assured
My rights, my wrongs are right till I'm right with God
When you know, we been hurt, been down before, nigga
When my pride was low, lookin' at the world like, "where do we go, nigga?"
And we hate Popo, wanna kill us dead in the street for sure, nigga
I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak and my gun might blow but we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid, a lot of changes
I'm alright and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self destruct, the evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers
Whats wrong nigga?
I thought you was keeping it gangsta?
I thought this what you wanted?
They say if you scared go to church
But remember
He knows the bible too
My baby when I get you get you get you get you
Ima go head to ride with you
Smoking lokin' poking the deja till I'm idle with you
Cause I (want you)
Now baby when I'm riding here I'm riding dirty
Registration is out of service
Smoking lokin' drinking the potion you can see me swerving
Cause I (want you)
I want you more than you know
I remember you took me to the mall last week baby
You looked me in my eyes about 4 5 times
Till I was hypnotized then you clarified
That I (want you)
You said Sherane ain't got nothing on Lucy
I said you crazy
Roses are red violets are blue but me and you both pushing up daisies if I (want you)
My baby when I get you get you get you get you
Ima go head to ride with you
Smoking lokin' poking the deja till I'm idle with you
Cause I (want you)
Now baby when I'm riding here I'm riding dirty
Registration is out of service
Smoking lokin' drinking the potion you can see me swerving
Cause I (want you)
I want you more than you know
You said to me
You said your name was Lucy
I said where's Ricardo?
I said oh no, not the show
Than you spit a little rap to me like this
When I turned 26 I was like oh shit
You said this to me
I remember what you said too you said
My name is Lucy Kendrick
You introduced me Kendrick
Usually I don't do this
But I see you and me Kendrick
Lucy Give you no worries
Lucy got million stories
About these rappers I came after when they was boring
Lucy gone fill your pockets
Lucy gone move your mama out of Compton
Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised
Lucy just want your trust and loyalty
Avoiding me?
It's not so easy I'm at these functions accordingly
Kendrick, Lucy don't slack a minute
Lucy work harder
Lucy gone call you even when Lucy know you love your father
I'm Lucy
I loosely heard prayers on your first album truly
Lucy don't mind cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me
Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front
Lucy got paper work on top of paper work
I want you to know that Lucy got you
All your life I watched you
And now you all grown up then sign this contract if that's possible
My baby when I get you get you get you get you
Ima go head to ride with you
Smoking lokin' poking the deja till I'm idle with you
Cause I (want you)
Now baby when I'm riding here I'm riding dirty
Registration is out of service
Smoking lokin' drinking the potion you can see me swerving
Cause I (want you)
I want you more than you know
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers
Until I came home
Description 1 Contributor?
This song offers a deeper insight into the previously introduced figure of Lucy. She seems to be more than a person, and represent his growing conflicts between old relationships and the effects of fame. In fact, as the song goes on, it is suggested that Lucy is short for Lucifer, hence the lines about temptation and signing contracts.

[Intro]
Oh shit!
Oh, I need that
I need that sloppy
That sloppy
Like a Chevy in quicksand
Yeah
That sloppy
[Verse 1]
This feelin' is unmatched
This feelin' is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap
Black [Pendleton] ball cap
(West, west, west)
We don't share the same synonym fall back
(West, west, west)
Been in it before internet had new acts
Mimicking radio's nemesis may be wack
My innocence limited the experience lacked
Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
The mind of a literate writer but I did it in fact
You admitted it once I submitted it wrapped in plastic
Remember scribblin' scratchin' dilligent sentences backwards
Visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction
Now I can live in a stadium, pack it the fastest
Gamblin' Benjamin benefits, sittin' in traffic
Spinnin' women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashion
Winnin' in every decision
Kendrick is master and mastered it
Isn't it lovely how menace has turned attraction?
Pivotin' rappers, finish your fraction while writing blue magic
Thank God for rap, I would say it got me a plaque
But what's better than that?
The fact it brought me back home
[Hook]
We been waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
[Verse 2]
I know everything, I know myself
I know morality, spirituality, good and bad health
I know fatality might haunt you
I know everything, I know Compton
I know street shit, I know shit that's conscious, I know everything
I know lawyers, advertisement and sponsors
I know wisdom, I know bad religion, I know good karma
I know everything, I know history
I know the universe works mentally
I know the perks of bullshit isn't meant for me
I know everything, I know cars, clothes, hoes and money
I know loyalty, I know respect, I know those that's ornery
I know everything, the highs to lows to groupies and junkies
I know if I'm generous at heart, I don't need recognition
The way I'm rewarded, well, that's God's decision
I know you know that lines from Compton School District
Just give it to the kids, don’t gossip about how it was distributed
I know how people work, I know the price of life
I know how much it’s worth, I know what I know and I know it well
Not to ever forget until I realized I didn’t know shit
The day I came home
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
I met a little boy that resembled my features
Nappy afro, gap in his smile
Hand me down sneakers bounced through the crowd
Run a number on man and woman that crossed him
Sun beamin' on his beady beads exhausted
Tossin' footballs with his ashy black ankles
Breakin' new laws mama passed on home trainin'
He looked at me and said Kendrick you do know my language
You just forgot because of what public schools had painted
Oh I forgot don't kill my vibe, that's right you're famous
I used to watch on Channel 5, TV was takin'
But never mind you're here right now don't you mistake it
It's just a new trip, take a glimpse at your family's ancestor
Make a new list, of everything you thought was progress
And that was bullshit, I mean your life is full of turmoil
You spoiled by fantasies of who you are
I feel bad for you
I can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin' you
If you resist, I'll back off, quick go catch a flight or two
But if you pick, destiny over rest in peace
Than be an advocate go tell your homies especially
To come back home
[Interlude]
This is a world premiere
This is a world premiere
This is a world premiere
[Verse 4]
I been lookin for you my whole life, an appetite
For the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside?
Is it in a woman, is it in money, or mankind?
Tell me something got me losing my mind, AH!
You make me wanna jump
(Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
(Let's talk about love))
(Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
(Let's talk about love))
I been lookin for you my whole life, an appetite
For the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside?
Is it in a woman, is it in money, or mankind?
Tell me something think I'm losing my mind, AH!
I say where you at, from the front to the back
I'm lookin' for you I react, only when you react
Ah, I thought I found you, back in the ghetto
When I was seventeen with the .38 special
Maybe you're in a dollar bill, maybe you're not real
Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel
Maybe I'm paranoid, ha, maybe I don't need you anyway
Don't lie to me I'm suicidal anyway
I can be your advocate
I can preach for you if you tell me what the matter is

[Intro]
K dot, pick up the phone, nigga. Every time I call, it's going to voice mail. Don't tell me they got you on some weirdo rap shit, nigga. No socks and skinny jeans and shit. Call me on Shaniqua's phone
[Hook]
I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo
Your home boy, your block that you're from, boo boo
Lil hoes you went to school with, boo boo
Baby mama and your new bitch, boo boo
We was in the hood, 14 with the deuce deuce
14 years later going hard, like we used to on the dead homies
On the dead homies
[Verse 1]
I don't give a fuck about no politics in rap, my nigga
My lil homie Stunna Deuce ain't never comin' back, my nigga
So you better go hard every time you jump on wax, my nigga
Fuck what they talkin' bout, your shit is where its at, my nigga
Came in this game, you stuck your fangs in this game
You wore no chain in this game your hood, your name in this game
Now you double up, time to bubble up the bread and huddle up
Stickin' to the scripts, now here if them benjamin's go cuddle up
Skip, hop, trip, drop, flip, flop with the white tube sock
It goes "Sherm Sticks, burn this"
Thats what the product smells like when the chemicals mix
50 nigga salute, out the Compton zoo, with the extras
El Cos, Monte Carlos, Road Kings and dressers
Rip Ridaz, P-Funkers, Mexicans, they fuck with you
Asians, they fuck with you, nobody can fuck with you
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Hopped out the caddy, just got my dick sucked
The little homies called, they said, "The enemies done cliqued up"
Oh yeah? Puto want to squabble with mi barrio?
Oh, yeah? Tell 'em they can run it for the cardio
Oh, yeah? Everythin' is everythin', it's scandalous
Slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras
The LAPD gamblin', scramblin', football numbers slanderin'
Niggas name on paper, you snitched all summer
The streets don’t fail me now
They tell me it's a new gang in town
From Compton to Congress
Set trippin’ all around
Ain’t nothin' new but a flow of new DemoCrips and ReBloodlicans
Red state versus a blue state, which one you governin’?
They give us guns and drugs, call us thugs
Make it they promise to fuck with you No condom they fuck with you
Obama say, "What it do?"
[Interlude]
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Everybody want to talk about who this and who that
Who the realest and who wack, or who white or who black
Critics want to mention that they miss when hip hop was rappin’
Motherfucker if you did, then Killer Mike'd be platinum
Y’all priorities are fucked up, put energy in wrong shit
Hennessy and Crown Vic, my memory been gone since
Don’t ask about no camera back at award shows
No, don’t ask about my bitch, no, don’t ask about my foes
'Less you askin' me about power, yeah, I got a lot of it
I’m the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button
Had the Coast on standby
“K. Dot, what up? I heard they opened up Pandora’s box”
I box ‘em all in, by a landslide
Nah homie we too sensitive, it spill out to the streets
I make the call and get the coast involved then history repeats
But I resolved inside that private hall while sitting down with Jay
He said "it's funny how one verse could fuck up the game"
I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo!
[Outro]
I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in a hotel room
I didn't want to self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn't stop survivors guilt
Going back and forth
Trying to convince my self the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting
A continuous war back in the city
I was entering a new one

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
How much a dollar really cost?
The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all
Gotta see how I’m chillin' once I park this luxury car
Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo
20 on pump six dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo
20 years ago, can't forget
Now I can lend all my ear or two how to stack these residuals
Tenfold, the liberal concept of what men'll do
20 on 6, he didn't hear me
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu
My American tongue was slurry
Walked out the gas station
A homeless man with a silly tan complexion
Asked me for ten rand
Stressin' about dry land
Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open
A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin'
He begged and pleaded
Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it
Told him, "Beat it"
Contributin' money just for his pipe, I couldn't see it
He said, "My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated
Listen to me, I want a single bill from you
Nothin' less, nothin' more"
I told him I ain't have it and closed my door
Tell me how much a dollar cost
[Hook: James Fauntleroy]
It's more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love
All you need, the air you breathe
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
He's starin' at me in disbelief
My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key
He's starin' at me, I started the car, then I tried to leave
And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see
The reason why he was mad at a stranger like I was supposed to save him
Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor
He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser
He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious
Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect
If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck
I never understood someone beggin' for goods
Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could
And this particular person just had it down pat
Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked
Have you ever opened up Exodus 14?
A humble man is all that we ever need
Tell me how much a dollar cost
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment
I never met a transient that demanded attention
They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin'
Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different
I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless
My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'?
So I'ma tell you like I told the last bum, crumbs and pennies
I need all of mines, and I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time
I got better judgement, I know when nigga's hustlin'
Keep in mind, when I was strugglin', I did compromise
Now I comprehend, I smell grandpa's old medicine
Reekin' from your skin, moonshine and gin
Nigga your babblin', your words ain't flatterin', I'm imaginin'
Denzel be lookin' at O'Neal
Cause now I'm in sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre, the jig is up
I seen you from a mile away losin' focus
And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy
You looked at me and said, "Your potential is bittersweet"
I looked at him and said, "Every nickel is mines to keep"
He looked at me and said, "Know the truth, it'll set you free
You're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehova, the higher power
The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit, the nerve
Of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost
The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss, I am God"
[Outro: Ronald Isley]
I wash my hands, I said my grace, what more do you want from me?
Tears of a clown, guess I'm not all what is meant to be
Shades of grey will never change if I condone
Turn this page, help me change, so right my wrongs

Complexion (two-step)
Complexion don't mean a thing (it's a Zulu love)
Complexion (two-step)
It all feels the same (it's a Zulu love)
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Dark as the midnight hour or bright as the mornin' sun
Give a fuck about your complexion, I know what the Germans done
Sneak (dissin’)
Sneak me through the back window, I’m a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
Even if master listenin', cover your ears, he 'bout to mention
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Dark as the midnight hour, I'm bright as the mornin' Sun
Brown skinned, but your blue eyes tell me your mama can't run
Sneak (dissin')
Sneak me through the back window, I’m a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
Even if master's listenin', I got the world's attention
So I'mma say somethin' that's vital and critical for survival
Of mankind, if he lyin', color should never rival
Beauty is what you make it, I used to be so mistaken
By different shades of faces
Then wit told me, "A woman is woman, love the creation"
It all came from God then you was my confirmation
I came to where you reside
And looked around to see more sights for sore eyes
Let the Willie Lynch theory reverse a million times with...
[Hook]
[Bridge]
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
[Verse 3: Rapsody]
Let me talk my Stu Scott, ‘scuse me on my 2Pac
Keep your head up, when did you stop? Love and die
Color of your skin, color of your eyes
That’s the real blues, baby, like you met Jay’s baby
You blew me away, you think more beauty in blue green and grey
All my Solomon up north, 12 years a slave
12 years of age, thinkin’ my shade too dark
I love myself, I no longer need Cupid
Enforcin’ my dark side like a young George Lucas
Light don’t mean you smart, bein’ dark don’t make you stupid
And frame of mind for them bustas, ain’t talkin’ “Woohah!”
Need a paradox for the pair of dots they tutored
Like two ties, L-L, you lose two times
If you don’t see you beautiful in your complexion
It ain’t complex to put it in context
Find the air beneath the kite, that’s the context
Yeah, baby, I’m conscious, ain’t no contest
If you like it, I love it, all your earth tones been blessed
Ain’t no stress, jigga boos wanna be
I ain’t talkin’ Jay, I ain’t talkin’ B
I’m talkin’ days we got school watchin’ movie screens
And spike your self esteem
The new James Bond gon’ be black as me
Black as brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea
And it’s all beautiful to me
Call your brothers magnificent, call all the sisters queens
We all on the same team, blues and pirus, no colors ain’t a thing
[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Barefoot babies with no cares
Teenage gun toters that don’t play fair, should I get out the car?
I don’t see Compton, I see something much worse
The land of the landmines, the hell that’s on earth
Everything black, I don't want black (They want us to bow)
I want everything black, I ain't need black (Down to our knees)
Some white, some black, I ain't mean black (And pray to a God)
I want everything black (That we don't believe)
Everything black, want all things black
I don't need black, want everything black
Don't need black, our eyes ain't black
I own black, own everything black
Six in the morn', fire in the street
Burn, baby, burn, that's all I wanna see
And sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain
It's such a shame they may call me crazy
They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'
But homie, you made me
Black don't crack, my nigga
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
Been feeling this way since I was 16, came to my senses
You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village
Pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me don't you?
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
You're fuckin' evil I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm guardin' my feelings, I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot
I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
And man a say they put me inna chains, cah' we black
Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars pon' me back
But now we have a big whip parked pon' the block
All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
Remember this, every race start from the block, just remember that
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
I mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society
That's what you're telling me, penitentiary would only hire me
Curse me till I'm dead
Church me with your fake prophesizing that I'mma be just another slave in my head
Institutionalized manipulation and lies
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
You hate me don't you?
I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt
Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out
Muscle cars like pull ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah
Black and successful, this black man meant to be special
CAT scans on my radar, bitch, how can I help you?
How can I tell you I'm making a killin'?
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot
I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
And man a say they put me inna chains, cah' we black
Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars pon' me back
But now we have a big whip parked pon' the block
All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
Remember this, every race start from the block, just remember that
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
When I finish this if you listenin' then sure you will agree
This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred
It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan
I'm black as the name of Tyrone and Darius
Excuse my French but fuck you — no, fuck y'all
That's as blunt as it gets, I know you hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, I can tell cause it's threats when I see you
I can tell cause your ways deceitful
Know I can tell because you're in love with that Desert Eagle
Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gone bleed him
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that want to build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door
Beefin' with Pirus, only death settle the score
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State "Marcus Garvey got all the answers"
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day
Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements
Or watch BET cause urban support is important
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street?
When gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?
Hypocrite!
Study long, study wrong, nigga
Hey, y'all close that front door, ya'll let flies in this motherfucker
Close that door!
My OG up in this motherfucker right now
My pops man with the bottle in his hand, actin' a fool
Hey, hey, baby check it out, I'mma tell you what my mama had said, she like:
I could spot you a mile away
I could see your insecurities written all on your face
So predictable your words, I know what you gonna say
Who you foolin'? Oh, you assuming you can just come and hang
With the homies but your level of realness ain't the same
Circus acts only attract those that entertain
Small talk, we know that it's all talk
We live in the Laugh Factory every time they mention your name
Askin', "where the hoes at?" to impress me
Askin', "where the moneybags?" to impress me
Say you got to burn your stash to impress me
It's all in your head, homie
Askin' "where the plug at?" to impress me
Askin' "where the jug at?" to impress me
Askin' "where it's at?" only upsets me
You sound like the feds, homie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
And the world don't expect you and the culture don't accept you
But you think it's all love
And the girls gon' neglect you once your parody is done
Reputation can't protect you if you never had one
Jealousy (complex), emotional (complex),
Self-pity (complex), under oath (complex)
The loudest one in the room, nigga, that's a complex
Let me put it back in proper context
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
Askin', "where the hoes at?" to impress me
Askin', "where the moneybags?" to impress me
Say you got to burn your stash to impress me
It's all in your head, homie
Askin' "where the plug at?" to impress me
Askin' "where the jug at?" to impress me
Askin' "where it's at?" only upsets me
You sound like the feds, homie
What do you got to offer?
Tell me before you we off ya, put you deep in the coffin
Been allergic to talkin', been aversion to bullshit
Instead of dreamin' the auction, tell me just who your boss is
Niggas be fugazie, bitches be fugazie
This is for fugazie niggas and bitches who make habitual line babies, bless them little hearts
You could never persuade me
You can never relate me to him, to her, or that to them
Or you, the truth you love to bend
In the back, in the bed, on the floor, that's your ho
On the couch, in the mouth, I be out, really though
So loud, rich niggas got low money
And loud, broke niggas got no money
The irony behind it is so funny
And I seen it all this past year
Pass on some advice we feel:
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
Is this mic on?
Hey! Hey! Turn the mic up!
I want the mic
We bringing up nobody-nobody-nobody
But the number one rapper in the world
He done travelled all over the world
He came back just to give you some game
All the little boys and girls, come up here
This for you, come on up
Kendrick, come on
I done been through a whole lot
Trial, tribulation, but I know God
The Devil wanna put me in a bow tie
Pray that the holy water don't go dry
As I look around me
So many motherfuckers wanna down me
But an enemigo never drown me
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me
(I love myself)
When you lookin' at me, ahh, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the bully
(I love myself)
Illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't be shy
(I love myself)
One day at a time, uhh
And when they say it's a war outside, bomb in the street
Gun in the hood, mob of police
Rock on the corner with a line full of fiend
And a bottle full of lean and a model on a scheme yup
These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation (Come to the front, yeah)
I duck these cold faces, post up fi-fie-fo-fum basis
Dreams of reality's peace
Blow steam in the face of the beast
Sky could fall down, wind could cry now
Look at me motherfucker, I smile
(I love myself)
When you lookin' at me, ahh, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the bully
(I love myself)
Illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't be shy
(I love myself)
One day at a time, uhh
Everybody lookin' at you crazy (Crazy)
What you gon' do? (What you gon' do?)
Lift up your head and keep moving (Keep moving)
Or let the paranoia haunt you? (Haunt you)
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
On my sleeve, let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence
How many times my potential was anonymous?
How many times the city making me promises?
So I promise this, nigga
(I love myself)
When you lookin' at me, ahh, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the bully
(I love myself)
Illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't be shy
(I love myself)
One day at a time, uhh
Walk my bare feet (Walk my bare feet)
Down, down valley deep (Down, down valley deep)
Fi-fie-fo-fum (Fi-fie-fo-fum)
My heart undone (My heart undone)
(I love myself)
When you lookin' at me, ahh, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the bully
(I love myself)
Illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't be shy
(I love myself)
One day at a time, uhh
I went to war last night
With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic
I'ma do it till I get it right
War last night
I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent
Duckin' every other blessin' I can never see the message
I could never take the lead, I could never bob and weave
From a negative and letting them annihilate me
And it's evident I'm moving at a meteor speed
Finna run into a building, lay my body-
*Argument breaks out in the crowd*
Not on my time, Not while I'm up here
Not on my time, kill the music
Not on my time
We could save that shit for the streets
We could save that shit, this for the kids bro
2015, niggas tired of playin' victim dawg
Niggas ain't trying to play vic-- since Tutu how many niggas we done lost?
Yeah, yeah, how many we done lost?
No forreal, answer the question, how many niggas we done lost bro?
This, this year alone
Exactly. So we ain't got time to waste time my nigga
Niggas gotta make time bro
The judge make time, you know that, the judge make time right?
The judge make time so it ain't shit
It shouldn't be shit for us to come out here and appreciate the little bit of life we got left dog
On the dead homies Charlie P. you know that bro
You know that
It's mando
And I say this because I love you niggas man
I love all my niggas bro
Exac — enough said, enough said
We gon get back to the show and move on, because that shit petty my nigga
Mic check, mic check, mic check, mic check, mic check
We gon do some acapella shit before we get back to --
All my niggas listen
Listen to this:
I promised Dave I'd never use the phrase "fuck nigga"
He said "think about what you saying, fuck niggas"
No better than Samuel on D'Jango
No better than a white man with slave boats
Sound like I needed some soul searching
My pops gave me some game in real person
Retrace my steps on what they never taught me
Did my home work fast before governement caught me
So I'ma dedicate this one verse to Oprah
On how the infamous, sensitive N-word control us
So many artist gave her an explanation to hold us
Well this is my explanation straight from Ethiopia
N-E-G-U-S definition: royality King royalty - wait listen
N-E-G-U-S description: Black emporor, King, ruler, now let me finish
The history books overlooked the word and hide it
America tried to make it to a house divided
The homies don't recognize we be using it wrong
So I'ma break it down and put my game in the song
N-E-G-U-S, say it with me
Or say no more. Black stars can come and get me
Take it from Oprah Winfrey
Tell her she right on time
Kendrick Lamar, by far, realest Negus alive
[Produced by Sounwave]
[Hook 1]
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said my nigga, let me ask this question:
[Bridge 1]
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan (one two, one two)
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Hook [1]
[Bridge 2]
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
[Verse 1]
Do you believe in me? Are you deceiving me?
Could I let you down easily, is your heart where it need to be?
Is your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime?
Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line?
If I’m tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off
If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car
Would you judge me a drug kid or see me as K. Lamar
Or question my character and degrade me on every blog
Want you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson
I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you’re very welcome
You tell me my song is more than a song, it’s surely a blessing
But a prophet ain’t a prophet til they ask you this question:
[Bridge 2]
[Hook 2]
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me
[Verse 2]
Do you believe in me? How much you believe in her?
You think she gon’ stick around if them 25 years occur?
You think he can hold you down when you down behind bars hurt?
You think y’all on common ground if you promise to be the first?
Can you be immortalised without your life being expired?
Even though you share the same blood is it worth the time?
Like who got your best interest? Like how much are you dependent?
How clutch are the people that say they love you and who pretending?
How tough is your skin when they turn you in, do you show forgiveness?
What brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended
What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing
What kind of bridge did they burn, revenge or your mind when it’s mentioned?
You wanna love like Nelson, you wanna be like Nelson
You wanna walk in in his shoes but you peace-making seldom
You wanna be remembered that delivered the message
That considered the blessing of everyone, this your lesson for everyone, say
[Bridge 2]
[Hook 2]
[Verse 3]
I been wrote off before, I got abandonment issues
I hold grudges like bad judges, don’t let me resent you
That’s not Nelson-like, want you to love me like Nelson
I went to Robben’s Island analysing, that’s where his cell is
So I could find clarity, like how much you cherish me
Is this relationship a fake or real as the heavens be?
See I got to question it all, family, friends, fans, cats, dogs
Trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow
Murphy’s Law, generation X, will I ever be your ex?
Floss off a baby step, mobbed by the mouth a bit
Pause, put me under stress
Crawled under rocks, ducking y’all, it’s respect
But then tomorrow, put my back against the wall
How many leaders you said you needed then left ‘em for dead?
Is it Moses, is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red?
Is it Martin Luther, JFK, shooter you assassin
Is it Jackie, is it Jesse, oh I know, it’s Michael Jackson, oh
[Bridge 3]
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
That nigga gave us Billie Jean, you say he touched those kids?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
[Hook 3]
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let my word be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me nigga, let me ask this question nigga
[Outro: Kendrick Lamar & 2Pac]
[Kendrick Lamar]
"I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
I didn’t wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn’t stop survivor’s guilt
Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new one
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned
The word was respect
Just because you wore a different gang colour than mine's
Doesn’t mean I can’t respect you as a black man
Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
But I don’t know, I’m no mortal man, maybe I’m just another nigga”
Shit and that’s all I wrote
I was gonna call it Another Nigga but, it ain’t really a poem, I just felt like it’s something you probably could relate to. Other than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you, I always wanted to ask you about a certain situa--, about a metaphor actually, you spoke on the ground. What you mean ‘bout that, what the ground represent?
[2Pac]
The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil
[Kendrick Lamar]
Right
[2Pac]
That’s how I see it, my word is bond. I see and the ground is the symbol for the poor people, the poor people is gonna open up this whole world and swallow up the rich people. Cause the rich people gonna be so fat, they gonna be so appetising, you know what I’m saying, wealthy, appetising. The poor gonna be so poor and hungry, you know what I’m saying it’s gonna be like… there might be some cannibalism out this mutha, they might eat the rich
[Kendrick Lamar]
Aight so let me ask you this then, do you see yourself as somebody that’s rich or somebody that made the best of their own opportunities?
[2Pac]
I see myself as a natural born hustler, a true hustler in every sense of the word. I took nothin’, I took the opportunities, I worked at the most menial and degrading job and built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it. I went from having somebody manage me to me hiring the person that works my management company. I changed everything I realised my destiny in a matter of five years you know what I’m saying I made myself a millionaire. I made millions for a lot of people now it’s time to make millions for myself, you know what I’m saying. I made millions for the record companies, I made millions for these movie companies, now I make millions for us
[Kendrick Lamar]
And through your different avenues of success, how would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?
[2Pac]
By my faith in God, by my faith in the game, and by my faith in all good things come to those that stay true. You know what I’m saying, and it was happening to me for a reason, you know what I’m saying, I was noticing, shit, I was punching the right buttons and it was happening. So it’s no problem, you know I mean it’s a problem but I’m not finna let them know. I’m finna go straight through
[Kendrick Lamar]
Would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?
[2Pac]
Shit, I like to think that at every opportunity I’ve ever been threatened with resistance it’s been met with resistance. And not only me but it goes down my family tree. You know what I’m saying, it’s in my veins to fight back
[Kendrick Lamar]
Aight well, how long you think it take before niggas be like, we fighting a war, I’m fighting a war I can’t win and I wanna lay it all down
[2Pac]
In this country a black man only have like 5 years we can exhibit maximum strength, and that’s right now while you a teenager, while you still strong or while you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back. Cause once you turn 30 it’s like they take the heart and soul out of a man, out of a black man in this country. And you don’t wanna fight no more. And if you don’t believe me you can look around, you don’t see no loud mouth 30-year old muthafuckas
[Kendrick Lamar]
That’s crazy, because me being one of your offspring of the legacy you left behind I can truly tell you that there’s nothing but turmoil goin’ on so I wanted to ask you what you think is the future for me and my generation today?
[2Pac]
I think that niggas is tired-a grabbin' shit out the stores and next time it’s a riot there’s gonna be bloodshed for real. I don’t think America know that. I think American think we was just playing and it’s gonna be some more playing but it ain’t gonna be no playing. It’s gonna be murder, you know what I’m saying, it’s gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831, up in this muthafucka. You know what I’m saying, it’s gonna happen
[Kendrick Lamar]
That’s crazy man. In my opinion, only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations, lotta people don’t understand how important it is. Sometimes I be like, get behind a mic and I don’t know what type of energy I’mma push out, or where it comes from. Trip me out sometimes
[2Pac]
Because the spirits, we ain’t really rappin’, we just letting our dead homies tell stories for us
[Kendrick Lamar]
Damn
I wanted to read one last thing to you. It’s actually something a good friend had wrote describing my world. It says:
“The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it
Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it, in order to protect itself from this mad city
While consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive
One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him, but praises the butterfly
The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness, and the beauty within the caterpillar
But having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits
Already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him
He can no longer see past his own thoughts
He’s trapped
When trapped inside these walls certain ideas start to take roots, such as going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city
The result?
Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant
Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered, ending the eternal struggle
Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different, they are one and the same."
What’s your perspective on that?
Pac, Pac, Pac
Every nigger is a star
Every nigger is a star
Every nigger is a star
Every nigger is a star
Hit me!
When the four corners of this cocoon collide
You'll slip through the cracks hoping that you'll survive
Gather your wind, take a deep look inside
Are you really who they idolize?
To pimp a butterfly
At first, I did love you
But now I just wanna fuck
Late night thinkin' of you
Until I got my nut
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board
Destroyed, but what for?
When I get signed, homie I'mma act a fool
Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room
Snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies
Blue eyed devil with a fat ass smokey
I'mma buy a brand new Caddy on fours
Trunk the hood up, two times, deuce four
Platinum on everything, platinum on wedding ring
Married to the game, made a bad bitch yours
When I get signed homie I'mma buy a strap
Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap
Take a few M-16s to the hood
Pass 'em all out on the block, what's good?
I'mma put the Compton swap meet by the White House
Republican, run up, get socked out
Hit the press with a Cuban link on my neck
Uneducated but I got a million dollar check, like that
We should never gave, we should never gave
Niggas money go back home, money go back home
We should never gave, we should never gave
Niggas money go back home, money go back home
At first, I did love you
But now I just wanna fuck
Late night thinkin' of you
Until I got my nut
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board
Destroyed, but what for?
Yo what's up? It's Dre
Remember the first time you came out to the house?
You said you wanted a spot like mine
But remember, anybody can get it
The hard part is keeping it, motherfucker
What you want you? A house or a car?
Forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anything, see, my name is Uncle Sam on your dollar
Motherfucker you can live at the mall
I know your kind (That's why I'm kind)
Don't have receipts (Oh man, that's fine)
Pay me later, wear those gators
Cliche and say, fuck your haters
I can see the borrow in you
I can see the dollar in you
Little white lies with a snow white collar in you
But it's whatever though because I'm still followin' you
Because you make me feel forever baby, count it all together baby
Then hit the register and make me feel better baby
Your horoscope is a gemini, two sides
So you better cop everything two times
Two coupes, two chains, two c-notes
Too much and enough both we know
Christmas, tell 'em what's on your wish list
Get it all, you deserve it Kendrick
And when you get the White House, do you
But remember, you ain't pass economics in school
And everything you buy, taxes will deny
I'll Wesley Snipe your ass before thirty-five
Lookin' down is quite a drop (It's quite a drop, drop)
Lookin' good when you're on top (When you're on top you got it)
A lot of metaphors, leavin' miracles metaphysically in a state of euphoria
Look both ways before you cross my mind
We should never gave, we should never gave
Niggas money go back home, money go back home
Tax man comin'
Tax man comin'
Tax man comin'
Tax man comin'
Tax man comin'
Fuck you, motherfucker, you a ho-ass nigga
I don't know why you trying to go big, nigga you ain't shit
Walking around like you God's gift to Earth, nigga you ain't shit
You ain't even buy me no outfit for the fourth
I need that Brazilian, wavy, twenty eight inch, you playin'
I shouldn't be fuckin' with you anyway, I need a baller ass, boss ass nigga
You'se a off brand ass nigga, everybody know it, your homies know it, everybody fuckin' know
Fuck you nigga, don't call me no more
You won't know, you gonna lose on the good bitch
My other nigga is on, you off
What the fuck is really going on?
This dick ain't free
You lookin' at me like it ain't a receipt
Like I never made end's meet, eatin' your leftovers and raw meat
This dick ain't free
Livin' in captivity raised my cap salary
Celery, tellin' me green is all I need
Evidently all I seen was spam and raw sardines
This dick ain't free, I mean, baby
You really think we could make a baby named Mercedes without a Mercedes Benz and twenty four inch rims, five percent tint, and air conditioning vents
Hell fuckin' naw, this dick ain't free
I need forty acres and a mule
Not a forty ounce and a pitbull
Bullshit, matador, matador, had the door knockin', whose that?
Genital's best friend, this dick ain't free
Pity the fool that made the pretty in you prosper
Titty juice and pussy lips kept me obnoxious, kept me up watchin'
Pornos and poverty, apology? No
Watch you volunteer it it while people less fortunate, like myself
Every dog has it's day, now doggy style shall help
This dick ain't free
Matter fact it need interest, matter fact it's nine inches
Matter fact see our friendship based on business
Pension, more pension, you're pinchin', my consensus
Been relentless, fuck forgiveness, fuck your feelings
Fuck your sources, all distortion, if you fuck it's more abortion
More divorce court and portion
My check with less endorsement left me dormant
Dusted, doomed, disgusted, forced with
Fuck you think is bullshit, porcelain pipes pressure, bust 'em twice
Choice is deaf, a state of decapitated the horseman
Oh America, you bad bitch, I the picked cotton that made you rich
Now my dick ain't free
I'mma get my Uncle Sam to fuck you up
You ain't no king

[Intro]
I got a bone to pick
I don't want you monkey mouth motherfuckers sittin' in
my throne again
(Aye aye nigga whats happenin' nigga, K-Dot back in
the hood nigga)
I'm mad (He mad), but I ain't stressin'
True friends, one question
[Hook]
Bitch where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin', King
Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, Kunta
Black man taking no losses
Bitch where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin', King
Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
[Verse 1]
When you got the yams (What's the yams?)
The yam is the power that be
You can smell it when I'm walking down the street
(Oh yes we can, oh yes we can)
I can dig rapping
But a rapper with a ghost writer? What the fuck
happened?
(Oh no) I swore I wouldn't tell
But most of y'all sharing bars like you got the bottom
bunk in a two man cell (A two man cell?)
Something's in the water (Something's in the water)
And if I gotta brown nose for some gold
Then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
When you got the yams (What's the yams?)
The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor
Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires
24/7, 365 days times two
I was contemplatin' gettin' on stage just to go back to
the hood, see my enemy and say...
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
(You goat mouth mammy fucker)
I was gonna kill a couple rappers but they did it to
themselves
Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin'
"Compton!"
I should probably run for Mayor when I'm done, to be
honest
And I put that on my Mama and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo woo!
Ah yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past 25 and there I was
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin' "Annie are you okay? Annie are you okay?"
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king
[Hook 2]
Bitch where was you when I was-
*POP*
(By the time you hear the next pop, the funk shall be
within you)
*POP*
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin', King
Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, (King) Kunta
Black man taking no losses
Bitch where was you when I was walkin'
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin', King
Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
[Outro]
(Funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk)
We want the funk
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it)
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it)
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it)
We want the funk
(Do you want the funk?)
We want the funk
(Do you want the funk?)
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it)
We want the funk
I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
What money got to do with it
When I don't know the full definition of a rap image?
I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I keep runnin' back for a visit
Hol' up, get it back
I said I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I could still kill me a nigga, so what?
[Interlude: Anna Wise]
If I was the president
I'd pay my mama's rent
Free my homies and them
Bulletproof my Chevy doors
Lay in the White House and get high, Lord
Who ever thought?
Master take the chains off me
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Life can be like a box of chocolate
Quid pro quo, somethin' for somethin', that's the obvious
Oh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it
Bitin' my style, you're salmonella poison positive
I can just alleviate the rap industry politics
Milk the game up, never lactose intolerant
The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious
Me scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges
Be all you can be, true, but the problem is
A dream's only a dream if work don't follow it
Remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this
I'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm probably just way too loyal
K Dizzle would do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god
Truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually you're never charged
But somethin' came over you once I took you to the fuckin' BET Awards
You lookin' at artists like the harvests
So many Rollies around you and you want all of them
Somebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry
I should've listened what my grandmama said to me
[Hook: Bilal]
Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass
Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga
Oh now, slow down
[Bridge: Snoop Dogg]
And once upon a time in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was 5 foot something, God bless the kid
Took his homie to the show and this is what they said
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Fuck am I s'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks?
The constant big money talk about mansions and foreign whips
The private jets and passports, presidential glass floor
Gold bottles, gold models, sniffin' up the ass for
Instagram flicks, suck a dick, fuck is this?
One more suck away from wavin' flashy wrist
My defense mechanism tell me to get him, quickly because he got it
It's the recession, then why the fuck he in King of Diamonds?
No more livin' poor, meet my .44
When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor
Now Kendrick, know they're your co-workers
But it's gon' take a lot for this pistol go cold turkey
Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay
But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA
Remember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor?
Well that's me at these awards
I guess my grandmama was warnin' a boy
She said...
[Hook]
[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
And once upon a time in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was 5 foot something, dazed and confused
Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse
You can take your boy out the hood but you can't take the hood out the homie
Took his show money, stashed it in the mozey wozey
Hollywood's nervous
Fuck you, goodnight, thank you much for your service

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence
Sometimes, I did the same
*Sound of a woman moaning*
If these walls could talk (x6)
Sex
[Bridge: Anna Wise]
She just want to close her eyes and sway
If you, if you, if you exercise your right to work it out
It's true, it's true, it's true, shout out to the birthday girls say hey
Say hey, everyone deserves a night to play
And she plays only when you tell her no
[Hook: Anna Wise (Bilal)]
If these walls could talk
(I can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you)
If these walls could talk
(I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it)
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
If these walls could talk they’d tell me to swim good
No boat I float better than he would
No life jacket I’m not the guard in Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Wall telling me they full of pain, resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me? I’m just a tenant
Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated
I interrogated every nook and cranny
I mean its still amazing before they couldn’t stand me
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when I’m here
These walls never could hold up
Everytime I come around demolition might crush
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
If these walls could talk they’d tell me to go deep
Yelling at me continuously I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down that’s my religion
Walls feeling like they ready to close in
I suffocate then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I don’t know how long I can wait in these walls
I’ve been on these streets too long looking at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song about how they walls are always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I must’ve missed them
I’m not involved I’d rather diss them
I’d rather call all you put your wall up
Cause when I come around demolition gon’ crush
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
If your walls could talk they’d tell you it’s too late
Your destiny accepted your fate
Burn accessories and stash them where they are
Take the recipe, the bible and god
Wall telling you that commissary is low
Race wars happening no calling CO
No calling your mother to save you
Homies to say you're reputable, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy Da Bull like a killer that turned snitch
Walls is telling me you a bitch
You pray for appeals hoping the warden could afford them
That sentence so important
Walls telling you to listen to "Sing About Me"
Retaliation is strong you even dream about me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted the same night
So when you play this song rewind the first verse
About me abusing my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hours of the morning
About her baby daddy currently serving life
And how she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
And how she fucking on a famous rapper
Walls could talk
[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in a hotel room
[Produced by Taz Arnold & Whoarei; Additional production by Sounwave]
[Screams]
[Hook x10]
Loving you is complicated
[Verse 1]
I place blame on you still
Place shame on you still
Feel like you ain't shit
Feel like you don't feel, confidence in yourself
Breakin' on marble floors
Watchin' anonymous strangers tellin' me that I'm yours
But you ain't shit I'm convinced your talent's nothin' special
What can I blame you for
Nigga I can name several
Situation had stopped with your little sister bakin'
A baby inside, just a teenager, where's your patience?
Where's your antennas, where is the influence you speak of?
You preached in front of 100,000 but never reached her
I fuckin' tell you, you fuckin' failure you ain't no leader
I never liked you, forever despise you I don't need you
The world don't need you, don't let them deceive you
Numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, thats for dedication
Thought money would change you, made you more complacent
I fuckin' hate you, I hope you embrace it
I swear
[Hook]
[Bridge]
Lovin' you, lovin' you, not lovin' you, one hundred proof
I can feel you vibin', recognize that your ashamed of me
Yes I hate you too
[Skit]
House keeping
*knocks*
House keeping
¡Abre la puerta! ¡Abre la puerta tengo que limpiar el cuarto!
¡Es que no hay mucho tiempo tengo que limpiar el cuarto¡
!Disculpe!
[Verse 2]
You the reason why mama and them leavin'
No you ain't shit, you say you love them, I know you don't mean it
I know you're irresponsible, selfish, in denial, can't help it
Your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it
Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out
You was deserted, where was your antennas again?
Where was your presence, where was your support that you pretend?
You ain’t no brother, you ain’t no disciple, you ain’t no friend
A friend never leave Compton for profit or leave his best friend
Little brother, you promised you’d watch him before they shot him
Where was your antennas, on the road, bottles and bitches
You faced time the one time, that's unforgiven
You even Facetimed instead of a hospital visit
You should thought he would recover, well
Third surgery couldn't stop the bleeding for real
Then he died, God himself will say "you fuckin' failed"
You ain't try
[Verse 3]
I know your secrets nigga
Mood swings is frequent nigga
I know depression is restin' on your heart for two reasons nigga
I know you and a couple block boys ain't been speakin' nigga
Y'all damn near beefin', I seen it and you're the reason nigga
And if this bottle could talk *gulp* I cry myself to sleep
Bitch everything is your fault
Faults breakin' to pieces, earthquakes on every weekend
Because you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed
I know your secrets
Don't let me tell them to the world about that shit you thinkin'
And that time you *gulp* I'm bout to hurl
I'm fucked up, but I'm not as fucked up as you
You just can't get right, I think your heart made of bullet proof
Shoulda killed yo ass a long time ago
You shoulda filled that black revolver blast a long time ago
And if those mirrors could talk it would say "you gotta go"
And if I told your secrets
The world'll know money can't stop a suicidal weakness
Alls my life I has to fight, nigga
Alls my life I
Hard times like God
Bad trips like: "God!"
Nazareth, I'm fucked up
Homie you fucked up
But if God got us we then gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Uh, and when I wake up
I recognize you're lookin' at me for the pay cut
Behind my side we lookin' at you from the face down
What mac-11 even boom with the bass down
Schemin'! And let me tell you bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
What pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my mama I love her but this what I like
Lord knows, 20 of 'em in my Chevy
Tell 'em all to come and get me, reapin' everything I sow
So my karma come and Heaven no preliminary hearing
So my record and my motherfucking gang can stand in silence for the record
Tell the world I know it's too late
The hoes, the girls think I gone crazy
Try and fight my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say
When you know, we been hurt, been down before, nigga
When my pride was low, lookin' at the world like, "where do we go, nigga?"
And we hate Popo, wanna kill us dead in the street for sure, nigga
I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak and my gun might blow but we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
What you want, a house or a car
40 acres and a mule, a piano a guitar
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
Motherfucker you can live with them all
I can see the evil, I can tell it I know when it's illegal
I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero
Thinkin' of my partner put the candy, paint it on the regal
Diggin' in my pocket ain't a profit, big enough to feed you
Everyday my logic, get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico ah!
I don't talk about it, be about it, everyday I see cool
If I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you
Pet dog, pet dog, pet dog, my dog that's all
Pick back and chat I shut the back for y'all
I rap, I'm black, on track and rest assured
My rights, my wrongs are right till I'm right with God
When you know, we been hurt, been down before, nigga
When my pride was low, lookin' at the world like, "where do we go, nigga?"
And we hate Popo, wanna kill us dead in the street for sure, nigga
I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak and my gun might blow but we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid, a lot of changes
I'm alright and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self destruct, the evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers
Whats wrong nigga?
I thought you was keeping it gangsta?
I thought this what you wanted?
They say if you scared go to church
But remember
He knows the bible too
My baby when I get you get you get you get you
Ima go head to ride with you
Smoking lokin' poking the deja till I'm idle with you
Cause I (want you)
Now baby when I'm riding here I'm riding dirty
Registration is out of service
Smoking lokin' drinking the potion you can see me swerving
Cause I (want you)
I want you more than you know
I remember you took me to the mall last week baby
You looked me in my eyes about 4 5 times
Till I was hypnotized then you clarified
That I (want you)
You said Sherane ain't got nothing on Lucy
I said you crazy
Roses are red violets are blue but me and you both pushing up daisies if I (want you)
My baby when I get you get you get you get you
Ima go head to ride with you
Smoking lokin' poking the deja till I'm idle with you
Cause I (want you)
Now baby when I'm riding here I'm riding dirty
Registration is out of service
Smoking lokin' drinking the potion you can see me swerving
Cause I (want you)
I want you more than you know
You said to me
You said your name was Lucy
I said where's Ricardo?
I said oh no, not the show
Than you spit a little rap to me like this
When I turned 26 I was like oh shit
You said this to me
I remember what you said too you said
My name is Lucy Kendrick
You introduced me Kendrick
Usually I don't do this
But I see you and me Kendrick
Lucy Give you no worries
Lucy got million stories
About these rappers I came after when they was boring
Lucy gone fill your pockets
Lucy gone move your mama out of Compton
Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised
Lucy just want your trust and loyalty
Avoiding me?
It's not so easy I'm at these functions accordingly
Kendrick, Lucy don't slack a minute
Lucy work harder
Lucy gone call you even when Lucy know you love your father
I'm Lucy
I loosely heard prayers on your first album truly
Lucy don't mind cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me
Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front
Lucy got paper work on top of paper work
I want you to know that Lucy got you
All your life I watched you
And now you all grown up then sign this contract if that's possible
My baby when I get you get you get you get you
Ima go head to ride with you
Smoking lokin' poking the deja till I'm idle with you
Cause I (want you)
Now baby when I'm riding here I'm riding dirty
Registration is out of service
Smoking lokin' drinking the potion you can see me swerving
Cause I (want you)
I want you more than you know
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers
Until I came home
Description 1 Contributor?
This song offers a deeper insight into the previously introduced figure of Lucy. She seems to be more than a person, and represent his growing conflicts between old relationships and the effects of fame. In fact, as the song goes on, it is suggested that Lucy is short for Lucifer, hence the lines about temptation and signing contracts.

[Intro]
Oh shit!
Oh, I need that
I need that sloppy
That sloppy
Like a Chevy in quicksand
Yeah
That sloppy
[Verse 1]
This feelin' is unmatched
This feelin' is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap
Black [Pendleton] ball cap
(West, west, west)
We don't share the same synonym fall back
(West, west, west)
Been in it before internet had new acts
Mimicking radio's nemesis may be wack
My innocence limited the experience lacked
Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
The mind of a literate writer but I did it in fact
You admitted it once I submitted it wrapped in plastic
Remember scribblin' scratchin' dilligent sentences backwards
Visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction
Now I can live in a stadium, pack it the fastest
Gamblin' Benjamin benefits, sittin' in traffic
Spinnin' women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashion
Winnin' in every decision
Kendrick is master and mastered it
Isn't it lovely how menace has turned attraction?
Pivotin' rappers, finish your fraction while writing blue magic
Thank God for rap, I would say it got me a plaque
But what's better than that?
The fact it brought me back home
[Hook]
We been waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
[Verse 2]
I know everything, I know myself
I know morality, spirituality, good and bad health
I know fatality might haunt you
I know everything, I know Compton
I know street shit, I know shit that's conscious, I know everything
I know lawyers, advertisement and sponsors
I know wisdom, I know bad religion, I know good karma
I know everything, I know history
I know the universe works mentally
I know the perks of bullshit isn't meant for me
I know everything, I know cars, clothes, hoes and money
I know loyalty, I know respect, I know those that's ornery
I know everything, the highs to lows to groupies and junkies
I know if I'm generous at heart, I don't need recognition
The way I'm rewarded, well, that's God's decision
I know you know that lines from Compton School District
Just give it to the kids, don’t gossip about how it was distributed
I know how people work, I know the price of life
I know how much it’s worth, I know what I know and I know it well
Not to ever forget until I realized I didn’t know shit
The day I came home
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
I met a little boy that resembled my features
Nappy afro, gap in his smile
Hand me down sneakers bounced through the crowd
Run a number on man and woman that crossed him
Sun beamin' on his beady beads exhausted
Tossin' footballs with his ashy black ankles
Breakin' new laws mama passed on home trainin'
He looked at me and said Kendrick you do know my language
You just forgot because of what public schools had painted
Oh I forgot don't kill my vibe, that's right you're famous
I used to watch on Channel 5, TV was takin'
But never mind you're here right now don't you mistake it
It's just a new trip, take a glimpse at your family's ancestor
Make a new list, of everything you thought was progress
And that was bullshit, I mean your life is full of turmoil
You spoiled by fantasies of who you are
I feel bad for you
I can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin' you
If you resist, I'll back off, quick go catch a flight or two
But if you pick, destiny over rest in peace
Than be an advocate go tell your homies especially
To come back home
[Interlude]
This is a world premiere
This is a world premiere
This is a world premiere
[Verse 4]
I been lookin for you my whole life, an appetite
For the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside?
Is it in a woman, is it in money, or mankind?
Tell me something got me losing my mind, AH!
You make me wanna jump
(Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
(Let's talk about love))
(Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
(Let's talk about love))
I been lookin for you my whole life, an appetite
For the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside?
Is it in a woman, is it in money, or mankind?
Tell me something think I'm losing my mind, AH!
I say where you at, from the front to the back
I'm lookin' for you I react, only when you react
Ah, I thought I found you, back in the ghetto
When I was seventeen with the .38 special
Maybe you're in a dollar bill, maybe you're not real
Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel
Maybe I'm paranoid, ha, maybe I don't need you anyway
Don't lie to me I'm suicidal anyway
I can be your advocate
I can preach for you if you tell me what the matter is

[Intro]
K dot, pick up the phone, nigga. Every time I call, it's going to voice mail. Don't tell me they got you on some weirdo rap shit, nigga. No socks and skinny jeans and shit. Call me on Shaniqua's phone
[Hook]
I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo
Your home boy, your block that you're from, boo boo
Lil hoes you went to school with, boo boo
Baby mama and your new bitch, boo boo
We was in the hood, 14 with the deuce deuce
14 years later going hard, like we used to on the dead homies
On the dead homies
[Verse 1]
I don't give a fuck about no politics in rap, my nigga
My lil homie Stunna Deuce ain't never comin' back, my nigga
So you better go hard every time you jump on wax, my nigga
Fuck what they talkin' bout, your shit is where its at, my nigga
Came in this game, you stuck your fangs in this game
You wore no chain in this game your hood, your name in this game
Now you double up, time to bubble up the bread and huddle up
Stickin' to the scripts, now here if them benjamin's go cuddle up
Skip, hop, trip, drop, flip, flop with the white tube sock
It goes "Sherm Sticks, burn this"
Thats what the product smells like when the chemicals mix
50 nigga salute, out the Compton zoo, with the extras
El Cos, Monte Carlos, Road Kings and dressers
Rip Ridaz, P-Funkers, Mexicans, they fuck with you
Asians, they fuck with you, nobody can fuck with you
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Hopped out the caddy, just got my dick sucked
The little homies called, they said, "The enemies done cliqued up"
Oh yeah? Puto want to squabble with mi barrio?
Oh, yeah? Tell 'em they can run it for the cardio
Oh, yeah? Everythin' is everythin', it's scandalous
Slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras
The LAPD gamblin', scramblin', football numbers slanderin'
Niggas name on paper, you snitched all summer
The streets don’t fail me now
They tell me it's a new gang in town
From Compton to Congress
Set trippin’ all around
Ain’t nothin' new but a flow of new DemoCrips and ReBloodlicans
Red state versus a blue state, which one you governin’?
They give us guns and drugs, call us thugs
Make it they promise to fuck with you No condom they fuck with you
Obama say, "What it do?"
[Interlude]
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Everybody want to talk about who this and who that
Who the realest and who wack, or who white or who black
Critics want to mention that they miss when hip hop was rappin’
Motherfucker if you did, then Killer Mike'd be platinum
Y’all priorities are fucked up, put energy in wrong shit
Hennessy and Crown Vic, my memory been gone since
Don’t ask about no camera back at award shows
No, don’t ask about my bitch, no, don’t ask about my foes
'Less you askin' me about power, yeah, I got a lot of it
I’m the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button
Had the Coast on standby
“K. Dot, what up? I heard they opened up Pandora’s box”
I box ‘em all in, by a landslide
Nah homie we too sensitive, it spill out to the streets
I make the call and get the coast involved then history repeats
But I resolved inside that private hall while sitting down with Jay
He said "it's funny how one verse could fuck up the game"
I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo!
[Outro]
I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in a hotel room
I didn't want to self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn't stop survivors guilt
Going back and forth
Trying to convince my self the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting
A continuous war back in the city
I was entering a new one

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
How much a dollar really cost?
The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all
Gotta see how I’m chillin' once I park this luxury car
Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo
20 on pump six dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo
20 years ago, can't forget
Now I can lend all my ear or two how to stack these residuals
Tenfold, the liberal concept of what men'll do
20 on 6, he didn't hear me
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu
My American tongue was slurry
Walked out the gas station
A homeless man with a silly tan complexion
Asked me for ten rand
Stressin' about dry land
Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open
A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin'
He begged and pleaded
Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it
Told him, "Beat it"
Contributin' money just for his pipe, I couldn't see it
He said, "My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated
Listen to me, I want a single bill from you
Nothin' less, nothin' more"
I told him I ain't have it and closed my door
Tell me how much a dollar cost
[Hook: James Fauntleroy]
It's more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love
All you need, the air you breathe
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
He's starin' at me in disbelief
My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key
He's starin' at me, I started the car, then I tried to leave
And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see
The reason why he was mad at a stranger like I was supposed to save him
Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor
He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser
He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious
Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect
If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck
I never understood someone beggin' for goods
Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could
And this particular person just had it down pat
Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked
Have you ever opened up Exodus 14?
A humble man is all that we ever need
Tell me how much a dollar cost
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment
I never met a transient that demanded attention
They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin'
Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different
I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless
My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'?
So I'ma tell you like I told the last bum, crumbs and pennies
I need all of mines, and I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time
I got better judgement, I know when nigga's hustlin'
Keep in mind, when I was strugglin', I did compromise
Now I comprehend, I smell grandpa's old medicine
Reekin' from your skin, moonshine and gin
Nigga your babblin', your words ain't flatterin', I'm imaginin'
Denzel be lookin' at O'Neal
Cause now I'm in sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre, the jig is up
I seen you from a mile away losin' focus
And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy
You looked at me and said, "Your potential is bittersweet"
I looked at him and said, "Every nickel is mines to keep"
He looked at me and said, "Know the truth, it'll set you free
You're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehova, the higher power
The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit, the nerve
Of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost
The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss, I am God"
[Outro: Ronald Isley]
I wash my hands, I said my grace, what more do you want from me?
Tears of a clown, guess I'm not all what is meant to be
Shades of grey will never change if I condone
Turn this page, help me change, so right my wrongs

Complexion (two-step)
Complexion don't mean a thing (it's a Zulu love)
Complexion (two-step)
It all feels the same (it's a Zulu love)
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Dark as the midnight hour or bright as the mornin' sun
Give a fuck about your complexion, I know what the Germans done
Sneak (dissin’)
Sneak me through the back window, I’m a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
Even if master listenin', cover your ears, he 'bout to mention
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Dark as the midnight hour, I'm bright as the mornin' Sun
Brown skinned, but your blue eyes tell me your mama can't run
Sneak (dissin')
Sneak me through the back window, I’m a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
Even if master's listenin', I got the world's attention
So I'mma say somethin' that's vital and critical for survival
Of mankind, if he lyin', color should never rival
Beauty is what you make it, I used to be so mistaken
By different shades of faces
Then wit told me, "A woman is woman, love the creation"
It all came from God then you was my confirmation
I came to where you reside
And looked around to see more sights for sore eyes
Let the Willie Lynch theory reverse a million times with...
[Hook]
[Bridge]
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
[Verse 3: Rapsody]
Let me talk my Stu Scott, ‘scuse me on my 2Pac
Keep your head up, when did you stop? Love and die
Color of your skin, color of your eyes
That’s the real blues, baby, like you met Jay’s baby
You blew me away, you think more beauty in blue green and grey
All my Solomon up north, 12 years a slave
12 years of age, thinkin’ my shade too dark
I love myself, I no longer need Cupid
Enforcin’ my dark side like a young George Lucas
Light don’t mean you smart, bein’ dark don’t make you stupid
And frame of mind for them bustas, ain’t talkin’ “Woohah!”
Need a paradox for the pair of dots they tutored
Like two ties, L-L, you lose two times
If you don’t see you beautiful in your complexion
It ain’t complex to put it in context
Find the air beneath the kite, that’s the context
Yeah, baby, I’m conscious, ain’t no contest
If you like it, I love it, all your earth tones been blessed
Ain’t no stress, jigga boos wanna be
I ain’t talkin’ Jay, I ain’t talkin’ B
I’m talkin’ days we got school watchin’ movie screens
And spike your self esteem
The new James Bond gon’ be black as me
Black as brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea
And it’s all beautiful to me
Call your brothers magnificent, call all the sisters queens
We all on the same team, blues and pirus, no colors ain’t a thing
[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Barefoot babies with no cares
Teenage gun toters that don’t play fair, should I get out the car?
I don’t see Compton, I see something much worse
The land of the landmines, the hell that’s on earth
Everything black, I don't want black (They want us to bow)
I want everything black, I ain't need black (Down to our knees)
Some white, some black, I ain't mean black (And pray to a God)
I want everything black (That we don't believe)
Everything black, want all things black
I don't need black, want everything black
Don't need black, our eyes ain't black
I own black, own everything black
Six in the morn', fire in the street
Burn, baby, burn, that's all I wanna see
And sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain
It's such a shame they may call me crazy
They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'
But homie, you made me
Black don't crack, my nigga
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
Been feeling this way since I was 16, came to my senses
You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village
Pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me don't you?
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
You're fuckin' evil I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm guardin' my feelings, I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot
I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
And man a say they put me inna chains, cah' we black
Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars pon' me back
But now we have a big whip parked pon' the block
All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
Remember this, every race start from the block, just remember that
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
I mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society
That's what you're telling me, penitentiary would only hire me
Curse me till I'm dead
Church me with your fake prophesizing that I'mma be just another slave in my head
Institutionalized manipulation and lies
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
You hate me don't you?
I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt
Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out
Muscle cars like pull ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah
Black and successful, this black man meant to be special
CAT scans on my radar, bitch, how can I help you?
How can I tell you I'm making a killin'?
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot
I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
And man a say they put me inna chains, cah' we black
Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars pon' me back
But now we have a big whip parked pon' the block
All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
Remember this, every race start from the block, just remember that
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
When I finish this if you listenin' then sure you will agree
This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred
It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan
I'm black as the name of Tyrone and Darius
Excuse my French but fuck you — no, fuck y'all
That's as blunt as it gets, I know you hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, I can tell cause it's threats when I see you
I can tell cause your ways deceitful
Know I can tell because you're in love with that Desert Eagle
Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gone bleed him
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that want to build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door
Beefin' with Pirus, only death settle the score
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State "Marcus Garvey got all the answers"
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day
Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements
Or watch BET cause urban support is important
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street?
When gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?
Hypocrite!
Study long, study wrong, nigga
Hey, y'all close that front door, ya'll let flies in this motherfucker
Close that door!
My OG up in this motherfucker right now
My pops man with the bottle in his hand, actin' a fool
Hey, hey, baby check it out, I'mma tell you what my mama had said, she like:
I could spot you a mile away
I could see your insecurities written all on your face
So predictable your words, I know what you gonna say
Who you foolin'? Oh, you assuming you can just come and hang
With the homies but your level of realness ain't the same
Circus acts only attract those that entertain
Small talk, we know that it's all talk
We live in the Laugh Factory every time they mention your name
Askin', "where the hoes at?" to impress me
Askin', "where the moneybags?" to impress me
Say you got to burn your stash to impress me
It's all in your head, homie
Askin' "where the plug at?" to impress me
Askin' "where the jug at?" to impress me
Askin' "where it's at?" only upsets me
You sound like the feds, homie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
And the world don't expect you and the culture don't accept you
But you think it's all love
And the girls gon' neglect you once your parody is done
Reputation can't protect you if you never had one
Jealousy (complex), emotional (complex),
Self-pity (complex), under oath (complex)
The loudest one in the room, nigga, that's a complex
Let me put it back in proper context
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
Askin', "where the hoes at?" to impress me
Askin', "where the moneybags?" to impress me
Say you got to burn your stash to impress me
It's all in your head, homie
Askin' "where the plug at?" to impress me
Askin' "where the jug at?" to impress me
Askin' "where it's at?" only upsets me
You sound like the feds, homie
What do you got to offer?
Tell me before you we off ya, put you deep in the coffin
Been allergic to talkin', been aversion to bullshit
Instead of dreamin' the auction, tell me just who your boss is
Niggas be fugazie, bitches be fugazie
This is for fugazie niggas and bitches who make habitual line babies, bless them little hearts
You could never persuade me
You can never relate me to him, to her, or that to them
Or you, the truth you love to bend
In the back, in the bed, on the floor, that's your ho
On the couch, in the mouth, I be out, really though
So loud, rich niggas got low money
And loud, broke niggas got no money
The irony behind it is so funny
And I seen it all this past year
Pass on some advice we feel:
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
Is this mic on?
Hey! Hey! Turn the mic up!
I want the mic
We bringing up nobody-nobody-nobody
But the number one rapper in the world
He done travelled all over the world
He came back just to give you some game
All the little boys and girls, come up here
This for you, come on up
Kendrick, come on
I done been through a whole lot
Trial, tribulation, but I know God
The Devil wanna put me in a bow tie
Pray that the holy water don't go dry
As I look around me
So many motherfuckers wanna down me
But an enemigo never drown me
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me
(I love myself)
When you lookin' at me, ahh, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the bully
(I love myself)
Illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't be shy
(I love myself)
One day at a time, uhh
And when they say it's a war outside, bomb in the street
Gun in the hood, mob of police
Rock on the corner with a line full of fiend
And a bottle full of lean and a model on a scheme yup
These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation (Come to the front, yeah)
I duck these cold faces, post up fi-fie-fo-fum basis
Dreams of reality's peace
Blow steam in the face of the beast
Sky could fall down, wind could cry now
Look at me motherfucker, I smile
(I love myself)
When you lookin' at me, ahh, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the bully
(I love myself)
Illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't be shy
(I love myself)
One day at a time, uhh
Everybody lookin' at you crazy (Crazy)
What you gon' do? (What you gon' do?)
Lift up your head and keep moving (Keep moving)
Or let the paranoia haunt you? (Haunt you)
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
On my sleeve, let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence
How many times my potential was anonymous?
How many times the city making me promises?
So I promise this, nigga
(I love myself)
When you lookin' at me, ahh, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the bully
(I love myself)
Illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't be shy
(I love myself)
One day at a time, uhh
Walk my bare feet (Walk my bare feet)
Down, down valley deep (Down, down valley deep)
Fi-fie-fo-fum (Fi-fie-fo-fum)
My heart undone (My heart undone)
(I love myself)
When you lookin' at me, ahh, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the bully
(I love myself)
Illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't be shy
(I love myself)
One day at a time, uhh
I went to war last night
With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic
I'ma do it till I get it right
War last night
I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent
Duckin' every other blessin' I can never see the message
I could never take the lead, I could never bob and weave
From a negative and letting them annihilate me
And it's evident I'm moving at a meteor speed
Finna run into a building, lay my body-
*Argument breaks out in the crowd*
Not on my time, Not while I'm up here
Not on my time, kill the music
Not on my time
We could save that shit for the streets
We could save that shit, this for the kids bro
2015, niggas tired of playin' victim dawg
Niggas ain't trying to play vic-- since Tutu how many niggas we done lost?
Yeah, yeah, how many we done lost?
No forreal, answer the question, how many niggas we done lost bro?
This, this year alone
Exactly. So we ain't got time to waste time my nigga
Niggas gotta make time bro
The judge make time, you know that, the judge make time right?
The judge make time so it ain't shit
It shouldn't be shit for us to come out here and appreciate the little bit of life we got left dog
On the dead homies Charlie P. you know that bro
You know that
It's mando
And I say this because I love you niggas man
I love all my niggas bro
Exac — enough said, enough said
We gon get back to the show and move on, because that shit petty my nigga
Mic check, mic check, mic check, mic check, mic check
We gon do some acapella shit before we get back to --
All my niggas listen
Listen to this:
I promised Dave I'd never use the phrase "fuck nigga"
He said "think about what you saying, fuck niggas"
No better than Samuel on D'Jango
No better than a white man with slave boats
Sound like I needed some soul searching
My pops gave me some game in real person
Retrace my steps on what they never taught me
Did my home work fast before governement caught me
So I'ma dedicate this one verse to Oprah
On how the infamous, sensitive N-word control us
So many artist gave her an explanation to hold us
Well this is my explanation straight from Ethiopia
N-E-G-U-S definition: royality King royalty - wait listen
N-E-G-U-S description: Black emporor, King, ruler, now let me finish
The history books overlooked the word and hide it
America tried to make it to a house divided
The homies don't recognize we be using it wrong
So I'ma break it down and put my game in the song
N-E-G-U-S, say it with me
Or say no more. Black stars can come and get me
Take it from Oprah Winfrey
Tell her she right on time

[Hook 1]
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said my nigga, let me ask this question:
[Bridge 1]
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan (one two, one two)
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Hook [1]
[Bridge 2]
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
[Verse 1]
Do you believe in me? Are you deceiving me?
Could I let you down easily, is your heart where it need to be?
Is your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime?
Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line?
If I’m tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off
If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car
Would you judge me a drug kid or see me as K. Lamar
Or question my character and degrade me on every blog
Want you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson
I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you’re very welcome
You tell me my song is more than a song, it’s surely a blessing
But a prophet ain’t a prophet til they ask you this question:
[Bridge 2]
[Hook 2]
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me
[Verse 2]
Do you believe in me? How much you believe in her?
You think she gon’ stick around if them 25 years occur?
You think he can hold you down when you down behind bars hurt?
You think y’all on common ground if you promise to be the first?
Can you be immortalised without your life being expired?
Even though you share the same blood is it worth the time?
Like who got your best interest? Like how much are you dependent?
How clutch are the people that say they love you and who pretending?
How tough is your skin when they turn you in, do you show forgiveness?
What brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended
What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing
What kind of bridge did they burn, revenge or your mind when it’s mentioned?
You wanna love like Nelson, you wanna be like Nelson
You wanna walk in in his shoes but you peace-making seldom
You wanna be remembered that delivered the message
That considered the blessing of everyone, this your lesson for everyone, say
[Bridge 2]
[Hook 2]
[Verse 3]
I been wrote off before, I got abandonment issues
I hold grudges like bad judges, don’t let me resent you
That’s not Nelson-like, want you to love me like Nelson
I went to Robben’s Island analysing, that’s where his cell is
So I could find clarity, like how much you cherish me
Is this relationship a fake or real as the heavens be?
See I got to question it all, family, friends, fans, cats, dogs
Trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow
Murphy’s Law, generation X, will I ever be your ex?
Floss off a baby step, mobbed by the mouth a bit
Pause, put me under stress
Crawled under rocks, ducking y’all, it’s respect
But then tomorrow, put my back against the wall
How many leaders you said you needed then left ‘em for dead?
Is it Moses, is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red?
Is it Martin Luther, JFK, shooter you assassin
Is it Jackie, is it Jesse, oh I know, it’s Michael Jackson, oh
[Bridge 3]
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
That nigga gave us Billie Jean, you say he touched those kids?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
[Hook 3]
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let my word be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me nigga, let me ask this question nigga
[Outro: Kendrick Lamar & 2Pac]
[Kendrick Lamar]
"I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
I didn’t wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn’t stop survivor’s guilt
Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new one
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned
The word was respect
Just because you wore a different gang colour than mine's
Doesn’t mean I can’t respect you as a black man
Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
But I don’t know, I’m no mortal man, maybe I’m just another nigga”
Shit and that’s all I wrote
I was gonna call it Another Nigga but, it ain’t really a poem, I just felt like it’s something you probably could relate to. Other than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you, I always wanted to ask you about a certain situa--, about a metaphor actually, you spoke on the ground. What you mean ‘bout that, what the ground represent?
[2Pac]
The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil
[Kendrick Lamar]
Right
[2Pac]
That’s how I see it, my word is bond. I see and the ground is the symbol for the poor people, the poor people is gonna open up this whole world and swallow up the rich people. Cause the rich people gonna be so fat, they gonna be so appetising, you know what I’m saying, wealthy, appetising. The poor gonna be so poor and hungry, you know what I’m saying it’s gonna be like… there might be some cannibalism out this mutha, they might eat the rich
[Kendrick Lamar]
Aight so let me ask you this then, do you see yourself as somebody that’s rich or somebody that made the best of their own opportunities?
[2Pac]
I see myself as a natural born hustler, a true hustler in every sense of the word. I took nothin’, I took the opportunities, I worked at the most menial and degrading job and built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it. I went from having somebody manage me to me hiring the person that works my management company. I changed everything I realised my destiny in a matter of five years you know what I’m saying I made myself a millionaire. I made millions for a lot of people now it’s time to make millions for myself, you know what I’m saying. I made millions for the record companies, I made millions for these movie companies, now I make millions for us
[Kendrick Lamar]
And through your different avenues of success, how would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?
[2Pac]
By my faith in God, by my faith in the game, and by my faith in all good things come to those that stay true. You know what I’m saying, and it was happening to me for a reason, you know what I’m saying, I was noticing, shit, I was punching the right buttons and it was happening. So it’s no problem, you know I mean it’s a problem but I’m not finna let them know. I’m finna go straight through
[Kendrick Lamar]
Would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?
[2Pac]
Shit, I like to think that at every opportunity I’ve ever been threatened with resistance it’s been met with resistance. And not only me but it goes down my family tree. You know what I’m saying, it’s in my veins to fight back
[Kendrick Lamar]
Aight well, how long you think it take before niggas be like, we fighting a war, I’m fighting a war I can’t win and I wanna lay it all down
[2Pac]
In this country a black man only have like 5 years we can exhibit maximum strength, and that’s right now while you a teenager, while you still strong or while you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back. Cause once you turn 30 it’s like they take the heart and soul out of a man, out of a black man in this country. And you don’t wanna fight no more. And if you don’t believe me you can look around, you don’t see no loud mouth 30-year old muthafuckas
[Kendrick Lamar]
That’s crazy, because me being one of your offspring of the legacy you left behind I can truly tell you that there’s nothing but turmoil goin’ on so I wanted to ask you what you think is the future for me and my generation today?
[2Pac]
I think that niggas is tired-a grabbin' shit out the stores and next time it’s a riot there’s gonna be bloodshed for real. I don’t think America know that. I think American think we was just playing and it’s gonna be some more playing but it ain’t gonna be no playing. It’s gonna be murder, you know what I’m saying, it’s gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831, up in this muthafucka. You know what I’m saying, it’s gonna happen
[Kendrick Lamar]
That’s crazy man. In my opinion, only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations, lotta people don’t understand how important it is. Sometimes I be like, get behind a mic and I don’t know what type of energy I’mma push out, or where it comes from. Trip me out sometimes
[2Pac]
Because the spirits, we ain’t really rappin’, we just letting our dead homies tell stories for us
[Kendrick Lamar]
Damn
I wanted to read one last thing to you. It’s actually something a good friend had wrote describing my world. It says:
“The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it
Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it, in order to protect itself from this mad city
While consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive
One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him, but praises the butterfly
The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness, and the beauty within the caterpillar
But having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits
Already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him
He can no longer see past his own thoughts
He’s trapped
When trapped inside these walls certain ideas start to take roots, such as going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city
The result?
Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant
Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered, ending the eternal struggle
Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different, they are one and the same."
What’s your perspective on that?
Pac, Pac, Pac
Lord God
I come to you a sinner
And I humbly repent for my sins
I believe that Jesus is Lord
I believe that you raised him from the dead
I will ask that Jesus will come to my life
And be my Lord and Savior
I receive Jesus to take control of my life
And that I may live for him from this day forth
Thank you Lord Jesus for saving me with your precious blood
In Jesus' name, Amen
I met her at this house party on El Segundo and Central
She had the credentials of strippers in Atlanta
Ass came with a hump from the jump she was a camel
I want to ride like Arabians, push an '04 Mercedes-Benz
"Hello my name is Kendrick," she said "No, you're handsome"
Whispered in my ear, disappeared then found her dancing
Ciara had played in the background
The parade music we made had us all wearing shades now (Cool)
"Where you stay?" She said "Down the street from Dominguez High"
Okay, I know that's borderline Compton or Paramount
"Well is it Compton?"
"No," she replied and quickly start batting her eyes and
Strictly had wanted her thighs around me
Seventeen, with nothing but pussy stuck on my mental
My motive was rather sinful
"What you trying to get into?"
She didn't tell, just gave me her Nextel
Dropped the number, we chirped the whole summer and well
The summer had passed and now I'm liking her
Conversation we having probably enticing her
Who could imagine, maybe my actions would end up wifing her
Love or lust, regardless we'll fuck cause the trife in us
It's deep rooted, the music of being young and dumb
Its never muted, in fact it's much louder where I'm from
We know a lot 'bout each other, her mother was a crack addict
She live with her granny and her younger two brothers
Her favorite cousin Demetrius's irrepetible
Family history of gang banging - did make me skeptical
But not enough to stop me from getting a nut
I wanna come over, what's up? That's what I told her soon as this episode
Of Martin go off, I'm trying to get off
I was in heat like a cactus, my tactics of being thirsty
Probably could hurt me, but fuck it I got some heart
Grab my momma's keys, hopped in the car, then oh boy
So now I'm down Rosecrans in a Caravan
Passing Alameda, my gas meter in need of a pump
I got enough to get me through the traffic jam
At least I hope cause my pockets broke as a promise man
I'm thinking bout that sex, thinking bout her thighs
Or maybe kissing on her neck, or maybe what positions next
Sent a picture of her titties blowing up my texts
I looked at 'em and almost ran my front bumper into Corvette
Enthused by the touch of a woman, she's a masseuse
And I'm a professional porn star when off the Goose
I had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransom
I'm hoping to get her loose like an Uncle Luke Anthem
I'm two blocks away, 250 feet
And six steps from where she stay, she waving me 'cross the street
I pulled up a smile on my face, and then I see
Two niggas, two black hoodies, I froze as my phone rang
Please leave your message for 323-
Record your message after the tone
Kendrick. Where you at? Head home! I'm sittin' here waitin' on my van
You told me you was gon' be back in fiffteen minutes!

These kids ready to eat! I'm ready to eat, shit
I gotta get them food stamps, come on now
You on you way or what?

Especially that crazy-ass girl Sherane
Plus you got school tomorrow
You keep fuckin' around in them streets, you ain't gon' pass to the next grade, 11th grade
(Is that Kendrick on the phone?)
Yo daddy hollerin' 'bout some damn dominoes
He want to holler at you too, gon' 'head Kenny, gon', shit!
(Hello? Yeah, where my motherfuckin' dominoes at?)

(He losing my damn dominoes)

This man fussin' 'bout some damn dominoes
It ain't all that serious. Fuck, damn dominoes
Shit I'mma miss my damn appointment! Fuck!
Fuck them damn dominoes, nobody wanna hear that
(Nobody want to hear yo' ass!
Mattafact, cut my motherfuckin' oldies back on
You killin' my motherfuckin' vibe
I am a sinner
Who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you to me is painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hanging with ya
Fell on my face and I woke with a scar
Another mistake living deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me then put me on stages
To me that's amazing
To you that's a quick check, with all disrespect let me say this
I am a sinner
Who is probably going to sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
I'm trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
You trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I'm looking right past ya
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know this is something you can blame
On yourself you can remain, stuck in a box
Ima break out and then hide every lock
Ima break out and then hide every lock
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me then put me on stages
To me that's amazing
To you that's a quick check, with all disrespect let me say this
I am a sinner
Who is probably going to sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
You ain't heard the Coast like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line
And they waiting on Kendrick like the 1st and the 15th
3's in the air I can see you are - in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings now what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My new year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfucking much, I got my drink I got my music
I say, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Martin had a dream
Martin had a dream
Kendrick have a dream
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for 72 hours
God damn I feel amazing, damn I'm in the matrix
My mind is living on cloud 9 and this 9 is never on vacation
Start up that Maserati and VROOM VROOM!
I'm racing
Poppin pills in the lobby and I pray they don't find her naked
And I pray you niggas is hating, shooters go after Judas
Jesus Christ if I live life on my knees, ain't no need to do this
Park it in front of Lueders, next to that Church's Chicken
All you pussies is losers, all my niggas is winners, screaming
Goddamn I got bitches
(okay!) damn I got bitches (okay!)
Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I've got 25 lighters on my dresser, yes sir
Put fire to that ass body cast on a stretcher
And her body got that ass that a ruler couldn't measure
And it make me cum fast but I never get embarrassed
And I recognize you have what I've been wanting since that record
That Adina Howard had pop it fast to impress her
She rollin' I'm holding my scrotum imposing
This voice here is golden so fuck y'all I goes in and
Damn I got bitches, damn I got
bitches
Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or nigga... It's go time!!!
I roll in dough with a good grind
And I run at ho with a baton
That's a relay race with a bouquet
They say, "
K, you gon' marry mines?"
Beeitch!!! (no way) Beeitch!!! (no way)
Beeitch!!! (no way) Beeitch!!! (okay)
I'm never living life confined
It's a failure even if I'm blind
I can tell ya who, what, when, where how
To sell ya game right on time
Beeitch!!! (go play) Beeitch!!! (go play)
Beeitch!!! (go play) Beeitch!!!
I look like OJ
Killing everything from pussy to a mothafuckin' Hit-Boy beat
She pussy poppin' and I got options like an audible, I be
C-O-M-P-T-O-N I win then ball at your defeat
C-O-M-P-T-O-N my city mobbin' in the street, yellin'
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for 72 hours
Goddamn I got bitches
Damn I got bitches
Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
Let it run Ali
Martin had a dream
Martin had a dream
Kendrick have a dream
Everybody, everybody
Everybody
Everybody sit your bitch ass down and listen to this true mothafuckin' story told by Kendrick Lamar on Rosecrans, ya bitch
Smoking on the finest dope
Aye aye aye aye
Drank until I can't no mo'
Aye aye aye aye
Really I'm a sober soul
But I'm with the homies right now
And we ain't asking for no favors
Rush a nigga quick then laugh about it later
Aye aye aye aye
Really I'm a peacemaker
But I'm with the homies right now
And momma used to say
One day, it's gon' burn you out
One day, it's gon' burn you out, out
One day, it's gon' burn you out
One day, it's gon' burn you
I'm with the homies right now
Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota
A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, and orange soda
Janky stash box when the federales roll up
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor
We on the mission for bad bitches and trouble
I hope the universe love you today
‘Cause the energy we bringing sure to carry away
A flock of positive activists and fill the body with hate
If it's necessary
Bumping Jeezy first album looking distracted
Speaking language only we know, you think it's an accent
The windows roll down all I see is a hand pass it
Hotboxing like George Foreman grilling the masses
Of the working world, we pulled up on a bunch of working girls
And asked them what they working with – look at me
I got the blunt in my mouth
Usually I'm drug-free, but shit I'm with the homies
(Yea nigga, we off a pill and Remy Red
Come through and bust ya head nigga)
Me and the homies
(Sag all the way to the liquor store
Where my niggas pour up 4 and get twisted some more)
Me and the homies
(I ride for my mothafuckin' niggas
Hop out, do my stuff, then hop back in)
Me and the homies
(Matter fact, I hop out that mothafucka and be like
"Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo!...Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo!")
It's 2: 30 and the sun is beaming
Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screaming
Hungry for anything unhealthy and if nutrition can help me
I'll tell you to suck my dick then I'll continue eating
We speeding on the 405 passing Westchester
You know the light skin girls in all the little dresses, good Lord
They knew we weren't from ‘round there
‘Cause every time we down there we pulling out the Boost Mobile sim cards
Bougie bitches with no extensions
Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination
Before we sparked a conversation
We seen three niggas in colors we didn't like then started interrogating
I never was a gangbanger, I mean I was never stranger to the folk neither
I really doubt it
Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it
That's ironic ‘cause I've never been violent, until I'm with the homies
(Just ridin', just ridin')
Me and the homies
(Bullshittin', actin' a fool)
Me and the homies
(Trippin', really trippin')
Me and the homies
(Just ridin', just ridin', just ridin'…)
Bragging ‘bout the episode we just had
A shot of Hennessey didn't make me feel that bad
I'm usually a true firm believer of bad karma
Consequences from evil will make your past haunt you
We tryna conquer the city with disobedience
Quick to turn it up, even if we ain't got the CD in
But Jeezy still playing and our attitude is still "nigga, what is you saying"
Pull in front of the house that we been camping out for like two months
The sun is going down as we take whatever we want
(Ay, ay, nigga cash out, pop the safe
Ay nigga, I think it's somebody in this room
Wait, what?
Nigga, it's somebody in this room!)
I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo
DVDs, plasma screen TVs in the trunk
We made a right, then made a left made a right
Then made a left, we was just circling life
My mama called – "Hello? What you doin'? "Kicking it"
I should've told her I'm probably ‘bout to catch my first offense with the homies
But they made a right, they made a left then made a right
Then another right
One lucky night with the homies
K. Dot, you faded, hood?
Yea we finally got that nigga faded. I think he hit the wrong blunt though
Ooh, which one?
Well which one he talking 'bout? I was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it
I prayed he hit that
Nah, that nigga straight. He ain't hit that one
Got the shenanigans? Give that nigga the shenanigans
Nigga I think we should push back to the city, fo real doe
Nigga, for what?
What that nigga, what's that Jeezy song say nigga?
"Last time I checked I was the man on these streets!"
Yea, yea, that shit right there. I'm tryna be the nigga in the street
There he go. Man you don't even know how the shit go
Look, here's the plan??. We gon' use the kickback as a alibi
Wait 'til the sun go down, roll out, complete the mission, drop K. Dot off at his mama van, at the park, cause I know he tryna fuck on Sherane tonight
Then we all gon' meet back at the block at about 10: 30
That's straight but we should meet up around 12; I'm tryna fuck on something too
Nigga sit yo dumb ass back down, nigga you ain't doing shit tonight
Matter fact, nigga get in the mothafuckin' car. We finna get active
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Me and my niggas tryna get it you bitch
Hit this house lick tell me is you with it you bitch
Home invasion was persuasive
From nine to five I know its vacant you bitch
Dreams of living life like rappers do
Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool
I fucked Sherene then went to tell my bros
Then Usher Raymond "Let it Burn" came on
Hot sauce in my Top Ramen, ya bitch
Parked the car and then we started rhyming, ya bitch
The only thing we had to free our mind
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs
You looking like an easy come up you bitch
A silver spoon I know you come from you bitch
And that's a lifestyle that we never knew
Go at a reverend for the revenue
[Hook]
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison tell me what you doEverybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
And I been hustlin' all day, this a way, that a way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel
A dollar might, just fuck your main bitch that's just how I feel
A dollar might, say fuck them niggas that you came with that's just how I feel
A dollar might, just make that lane switch that's just how I feel
A dollar might, turn to a million and we all rich that's just how I feel
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Dreams of living life like rappers do
Bump that new E-40 after school
You know big ballin with my homies
Earl Stevens had us thinking rational
Back to reality we pour
Another casualty of war
Two bullets in my uncle tony head
He said one day I'd be on tour
That Louie's Burger never be the same
A louis belt will never ease that pain
But I'mma purchase when that day is jerkin'
Pull off at Church's with Pirelli's skirtin'
Gang signs out the window
Hoping all of em offend you
They say your hood is a pot of gold
And we gone crash it when nobodies home
[Hook]
[Unknown Girl Sings]
Be the last one out to get this dough? , No Way
Love one of you bucket headed hoes?, No Way
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No Way
Hit the brakes, when they on patrol..No Way. [2x]
[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
Imagine Rock up in the projects
Where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings
Liquor spilling pistols popping
Baking soda YOLA whipping
Ain't no turkey on Thanksgiving
My homeboy just domed a nigga
I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue
Everyday I'm hustling
What else is a thug to do?
When you eatin' cheese from the government
Gotta provide for my daughter 'n'em
Get the fuck up out my way, bitch
Got that drum and got them bass
Just like a parade, bitch
Drop that work up in the bush
And just hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do tell the truth
This the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut
Them serpents lurking blood
Bitches selling pussy, niggas selling drugs
But it's all good
Broken promise sister you're watching tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a footlocker is
In the streets with a heater under my dungarees
Dreams of me getting shaded under a money tree
[Intro]
Every second, every minute, man I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch put your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now, put me in the mood
I'm talking 'bout dark room, perfume
Go, go!
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I recognize your fragrance (hol' up!)
You ain't never gotta say shit (woo!)
And I know your taste is
A little bit (mmm) high maintenance (ooh)
Everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it ?
I mean write poems in these songs dedicated to you
And you're in the mood for empathy, theres blood in my pen
Better yet when your friends and them
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and
Y'all curled in that little bitty range I heard that
She wanna go and party, She wanna go and party
Nigga don't approach her with that Atari
Nigga that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation, rule a nation, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs
'less I write it down for real, P.S
[Hook x2: Kendrick Lamar]
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just know just know just know just know just
What you want, Poetic Justice, put it in a song
[Verse 2: Drake]
I really hope you play this
Cause ol' girl you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs and all these one off vacations
You've been taken
Clearly a lot for me to take in
It don't make sense
Young East African Girl, you too busy fucking with your other man
I was trying to put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your mama to the motherland
I could do it, maybe one day
When you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's all right here in the city
And you don't run from where we come from
That sound like Poetic Justice, Poetic Justice
You were so new to this life but God damn you got adjusted
I mean I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin, and your big ass in that sundress (ooh!)
Good God, what you doing that walk for?
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
And they say communication saves relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write them down for real
P.S...
[Hook]
[Verse 3 : Kendrick Lamar]
Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Making sure my punctuation curve
Every letter is true
Living my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talking poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it ?
I mean you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb, It's you looking in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, It's you looking poor maybe
Call me crazy, We can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common
And what we have common is pain
I mean you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb and I can see power steering
Sex drive when you swerve, I want that interference
It's coherent, I can hear it, mmhmm
That's your heartbeat
It either caught me or it called me, mmhmm
Breathe slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly
And right before you go blind
P.S.....
[Hook]
[Skit]
"I'm gon' ask you one more time homie, where is you from? Or it is a problem"
"Ay you over here for Sherane homie?"
"Yo I don't care who this nigga over here for, if he don't tell where he come, it's a wrap! I'm sorry"
"Hol' up hol' up hol' up, we gon' do it like this, OK? I'mma tell you where I'm from, you gon' tell me where you from, OK? Or where your Grandma stay, where your mama stay, or where your daddy stay, OK?"
"Enough with all this talkin"
"Matter of fact, get out the van homie. Get out the car before I snatch you out that mother fucker homie"
Mass hallucination baby
Ill education baby
Want to reconnect with your elations
This is your station baby
Look inside these walls and you see them having withdrawals
Of a prisoner on his way
Trapped inside your desire
To fire bullets that stray
Track a tire just tell you I'm tired and ran away
I should ask a choir what do you require
To sing a song that acquire me to have faith
As the record spin I should pray
For the record I recognize that I'm easily prey
I got ate alive yesterday
I got animosity building
It's probably big as a building
Me jumping off of the roof
Is me just playing it safe
But what am I supposed to do
When the topic is red or blue
And you understand that I ain't
But know I'm accustomed to
Just a couple that look for trouble
And live in the street with rank
No better picture to paint than me walking from bible study
And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face
From a function that tooken place
They was wondering if I bang
Step on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks
I don't mind because one day you respect
The good kid, m.A.A.d. city
Mass hallucination baby
Ill education baby
Want to reconnect with your elations
This is your station baby
All I see is strobe lights
Blinding me in my hindsight
Finding me by myself
Promise me you can help
In all honesty I got time to be copacetic
Until you have finally made a decision to hold me against my will
It was like a head on collision that folded me standing still
I can never pick out the difference
And grade a cop on the bill
Every time you clock in the morning
I feel you just want to kill
All my innocence while ignoring my purpose
To persevere as a better person
I know you heard this and probably in fear
But what am I supposed to do
With the blinking of red and blue
Flash from the top of your roof
And your dog has to say woof
And you ask "lift up your shirt"
Cause you wonder if a tattoo
Of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
Gang files, but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile
I heard them chatter: "He's probably young but I know that he's down"
Step on his neck as hard as your bullet proof vest
He don't mind, he know we never respect
The good kid, m.A.A.d. city
Mass hallucination baby
Ill education baby
Want to reconnect with your elations
This is your station baby
All I see in this room
20 Xanies and these 'shrooms
Grown-up candy for pain
Can we live in the same society
It's entirely stressful upon my brain
You hired me as a victim
I quietly hope for change
When violence is the rhythm
Inspired me to obtain
The silence in this room
With 20 Xanies and 'shrooms
Some grown-up candy I lost it
I feel it's nothing to lose
The streets sure to release the worst side of my best
Don't mind, cause now you ever in debt
To good kid, m.A.A.d. city
Mass hallucination baby
Ill education baby
Want to reconnect with your elations
This is your station baby
[Intro/Bridge]If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street I hear
[ScHoolBoy Q]
"YACK! YACK! YACK! YACK!"
[Hook]
"Man down
Where you from, nigga?"
"Fuck who you know, where you from my nigga?"
"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"
This m.A.A.d city like, "Run, my nigga."
[Verse 1]
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin crack or move cocaine
This is cul de sac and plenty congnac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin on your brain
It was Me, O-Boog[?], and Yaya[?] watchin Lucky ride down Rosecrantz
It got ugly, wavin yo hand out the window. Check yo self
Uh, warriors and Conans
Hope euphoria can slow dance with society
The driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand, where --- hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder saying that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin at him different
That was back when I was nine
Joey packed the nine
Packed to stand on every porch was fine
We adapt to crime, pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin for if you ain't walkin up?
You fuckin punk, pickin up the fuckin pump
Pickin off you suckers, suck a dick or die or sucker punch
Or warn the bullets comin from
AK's,AR's,"aye y'all. Duck."
That's what momma said when we was eatin the free lunch
Aw man, God damn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94. Fuck yo truce
Now crawl yo head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just pieces
BG's up to pre-approve, bodies on top of bodies
IV's on top of IV's
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trollie
Make sure your colors correct
Make sure you're cornbread, or they'll be callin your mother collect
They say the governor collect, all of our taxes except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin backwards if you suggest that you sleep wit a Teck
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess
M.A.A.d city
[Hook]
"Man down
Where you from, nigga?"
"Fuck who you know, where you from my nigga?"
"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"
This m.A.A.d city like, "Run, my nigga."
[Intro/Bridge]
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street I hear
[ScHoolBoy Q]
"YACK! YACK! YACK!---
(static)
[MC Eiht]
Wake yo punk ass up!
It ain't nothin but a Compton thang
Chyea
Real simple and plain
I'mma teach you some lessons about the street
It ain't nothin but a Compton thang
Chyea
How we do
[Verse 2]
Fresh outta school cause I was a high school grad
Sleeping in the living room in my momma's pad
Reality struck I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole two nigga's hopped out on foot and dahsed
My Pops said I needed a job I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leaving
In fact I got fired because I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I really don't smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foaming at the mouth
I was straight tweaking the next weekend we broke even
I made a legion then made a promise to see you bleeding
You know the reasons but still won't ever know my life
Kendrick AKA Compton's human sacrifice
[Mc Eight]
Cocaine, weed
Nigga's been mixing shit since the 80's loc
Shine sticks, buck nakeds
Make a nigga flip
Coke heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alandra, Rosecrants, Bullice
I'm still in the hood
Loc yeah that's cool
The hood took me under so I follow the rules
But yeah that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doing the same thing
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately
Couple of IV's with the fucking spraycan
Shots in the crowd then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, harsh turn brave
Mount up regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip
Trip, we in the hood still
So loc, grab a strap cause yeah, it's so real
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and 10 grand's where motherfuckers stand
[Kendrick Lamar]
If I told you I killed a nigga at 16, would you believe me?
Or see me to be innocent Kendrick that you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now & Laters to eat
If I'm mashing all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of being a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the corners like hostage
Kill them all if they gossip, the Children of the Corn
They realizing the option of living a lie, drive they body with toxins
Constantly drinking and drive, hit the power then watch this flame
That arrive in his eye; this a coward, the concept is aim and
They bang it and slide out that bitch with the pies
And the price on his head, the tots probably go to the projects
I live inside the belly of the rough
Compton, U.S.A. made Me an Angel on Angel Dust, what
Pour up, dank, head shot, dank
Sit down, dank, stand up, dank
Pass out, dank, wake up, dank
Faded, dank, faded, dank
Now I done grew up 'round some people living their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask, back stroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels, some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in the dark room, loud tunes, looking to make a vow soon
That I'mma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup, I see the crowd mood
Changing by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me:
Nigga why you babysittin only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it
Pour up, dank, head shot, dank
Sit down, dank, stand up, dank
Pass out, dank, wake up, dank
Faded, dank, faded, dank
Okay, now open your mind up and listen to me, Kendrick
I'm your conscience, if you do not hear me, then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now and I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down I'mma drown in some poison abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes
I see the feelin', the freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrive
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice
Then apparently, I'm over influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most then someone said to me
Nigga why you babysittin only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it
Pour up, dank, head shot, dank
Sit down, dank, stand up, dank
Pass out, dank, wake up, dank
Faded, dank, faded, dank
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out. Do you; bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you, bang
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
Nigga why you babysittin only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it
Pour up, dank, head shot, dank
Sit down, dank, stand up, dank
Pass out, dank, wake up, dank
Faded, dank, faded, dank
Aw man, what is she taking?
Where is she taking
All I, all I, all I, all I, all I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got Hunger pain that grow insane, tell me do that sound familiar?
If it do then you're like me, making excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release everything that corrode inside of me
I see you joking, why you laugh? don't you feel bad?
I probably sleep and never ever wake up
Never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust
But just when I thought I had enough
When the lights shut off
And its my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off
And its my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow
I'm hoping that I can borrow a piece of mind
I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright
And a fight he tried to put up, but the type
Of bullet that stuck had went against his will
As blood spilled on your hands
My plans rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back whispering, "Get em"
I got em, and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality that told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover
A passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a young'n
In pajamas and Dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs
Dumb niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child
I'm proud and well devoted
This piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'mma push it, wherever whenever
And I love you cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop I hope
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off
And its my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it "Section .80," the message resemble "Brenda's Got a Baby"
Whats crazy was, I was hearin about it
But doubted your ignorance, how could you ever
Just put her on blast and shit
Judging her past and shit
Well it's completely my future
A nigga behind me right now asking for ass and shit
And I'mma need that 40 dollars even if I gotta
Fuck, suck and swallow in the parking lot
Gonzales Park, I'm followed by a married man, a father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tingling keys
Matter of fact he my favorite cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get em back
To where they used to be then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman, or better yet a leader
You need her to learn something, then you probably need to beat her
That's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted
But fuck that "Sorry for your loss" shit
My sister died in vain, but what point are you trying to gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait
Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
Cause I don't need the attention bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away
I know my fate, and I'm on the grind for this cake
I'mma get or die trying, I'm eyeing every male gender with intentions of buying
You lying to these motherfuckers, talking about you can help with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me nigga, fuck your glory nigga, this bullshit...
When the lights shut off
And its my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off
And its my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
Sometimes I look in a mirror and ask myself
Am I really scared of passing away
If it's today I hope I hear a
Cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the holy ghost till it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline
Rake in the scent of a reaper, ensuring that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon
And if I'm doomed, may the wound
Help my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot
And every day the glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about
Cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the scheme of, wondering when I'mma rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
In a direction to speak of something that's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't trying to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like "it need to be told"
Cursing the life of 20 generations after her soul
Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continued rappin
Or steady being distracted by money drugs and four
Fives, I count lives all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fighting for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Now am I worth it?
Did I put enough work in?
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off
And its my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
(Dying of Thirst)
Tired of running
Tired of hunting
My own kind
But retiring nothing
Tires are steady screeching, the driver is rubbing
Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dope on the corner
Look at the coroner
Daughter is dead
Mother is mourning her
Strayed bullets
AK bullets
Resuscitation was waiting patiently but they couldn't
Bring her back
Who got the footage?
Channel 9
Cameras is looking
It's hard to channel your energy when you know you're crooked
Banana clip, split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
How many sins?
I'm running out
How many sins?
I lost count
Dreams of ballin' like Spalding
But only shotty bounce
The reefer calling
I'm cottonmouth
Money is power, yours is ours
Lay with a snitch, die with a coward
Hope we get rich, hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song
A black flower
I'll show you how to
Dye your thirst
Dye your thirst
Dye your thirst
What are we doing?
Who are we fooling?
Hell is hot, fire is proven
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live right just by how to shoot it
Tired of running, s is humming
Tell us to visit, we lying about coming
Now back to business, loading the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is viewed
And the beef is bubbling
It's no discussion, hereditary
All of my cousins
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Too many sins
I'm running out
Somebody send
Me a well for the drought
See, all I know, is taking notes
On taking this life for granted
Granted, if he provoke
My best days, I stress days
(Lord forgive me for all my sins for I not know...)
My best days, I stress days
Say "Fuck the world," my sex slave
Money, pussy and greed; what's my next crave
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
Tired of running, tired of running
Tired of tumbling, tired of running
Tired of tumbling
Back once my momma say
"See a pastor, give me a promise
What if today was the rapture, and you completely tarnished
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dying of thirst
You dying of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works"
(Fuck... I'm tired of this shit.)
(I'm tired of fucking running... Tired of this shit... my brother, homie!)
(Is that what I think that is?!)
(I know that's not what I think that is...)
(Why are you so angry?...)
(See, you young men are dying of thirst. Do you know what that means?)
(That means that you need WATER... HOLY water.)
(You need to baptized with the Spirit of the Lord.)
(Do you want to receive God as your personal savior?)
(Ok... Repeat after me)
(Lord, God, I come to you, a sinner)
(And I humbly repent for my sins.)
(I believe that Jesus is Lord.)
(I believe You raised him from the dead.)
(I would ask that Jesus come into my life)
(And be my Lord, and Savior.)
(I receive Jesus to take control of my life)
(And that I might live for Him from this day forward.)
(Thank you Lord Jesus, for saving me with Your Precious Blood)
(In Jesus' name... Amen)
(Alright now... remember this day.)
[Hook]
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say
When I feel, and I... 
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air
I'm proud to say yea
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really really real *(x4)
[Verse 1] 
I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie even if they tell
Sweet lullabies that come with a smell
Of a dozen roses flippin' down *a green hill
You living in a world that come with plan B
Cause plan A never relay a guarantee
And plan C never could say just what it was
And your plans only can pan around love
You love him, you love them, you love her 
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love red-bottom and gold they say queen
You love hand-bag on the waist of your jean 
You love french tip and trip that pay for 
You love bank slip that tell you we paid more
You love a good hand whenever the card dealt 
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie even if they fell
Out the sky and your optics? turn stale
Where they *mold that's green
I can see you fit the bell
Of living in a world that come with Plan B
Cause Plan A only can make another mistake 
And you can't see success coming from plan C
When it all breaks you, you still say you love me
And love them and love when you love her 
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love fast cars and their present is old
You love fast women
You love keepin' control
Of everything *that you love, you love beef
You love streets, you love runnin', duckin' police
You love your hood, might even love it to death
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
The reason why I know you very well
Cause we have the same eyes can't you tell
The days I tried to cover up and conceal
My pride, it only made it harder for me to deal
When living in a that come with plan B
A scapegoat cause plan A don't come for free
And plan C just an excuse like because
Or the word "but", but what if I got love
I love them, I love when I love her
I love so much, I love when love hurts
I love first verse cause you're the girl I attract
I love second verse cause your the homie they packed
Burning like a stove top, they love cooking from scratch
I love what the both of you have to offer
In fact, I love it so much
I don't love anything else
But what love got to do with it when I don't love myself
To the point I should hate everything I do love
Should I hate living my life inside the club
Should I hate her for watching me for that reason
Should I hate him for telling me that I'm season
Should I hate them for telling me ball out
Should I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about
Hatin' all money, power, respect in my will
I'm hatin' the fact that none of that shit make me real
[Verse 1: Kendrick]
Now everybody serenade the new faith of Kendrick Lamar
This is king Kendrick Lamar
King Kendrick and I meant it, my point intended is raw
Fix your lenses forensics would've told you Kendrick had killed it
Pretend it's a massacre and the masses upon us
And I mastered being the master and dodging your honor
And the chapter that read at 25 I would live dormant like 5 in the morning
Then ring your spot while Kendrick's performing
And if they take everything, know I got
[Hook]
Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine
(Ay, Dre what's happenin' wit' it my nigga!)
[Verse 2: Dre]
Still I'm mad, peel the plastic off it, you can feel the magic
Still I'm laughing at the critics talking, I can see 'em gagging
When I'm back in the back of my city, back in the back
With a batch of them bangin' Dre Beats with me, look where I'm at
It's the murder cap' and I'm captain at birth of this gangsta rap
It's a wrap when I'm done and I come a long way from a hundred dollars a month
To a hundred mil' in a day, bitch I'm from
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Kendrick]
So come and visit the tire screeching, ambulance, policeman
Won't you spend a weekend on Rosecrans nigga
Khaki creasing, crime increasing on Rosecrans nigga
Kendrick Conan nigga
Where you sword at, hand on the cross and swore that
I do it big as Rasputia for them shooters Kama Sutra scream fuck your position and make you hold that
I'm trying to stay grounded like four flats
But I know flats and Piru Crip tats
Will swarm on me like a beehive
Hop in the G ride
From the West to the East side
Know that's just how Compton roll
[Verse 4: Dre (and Kendrick)]
And that's a given
I pass the blunt then pass the torch of course that's my decision
I crash the Porsche then you report that you see me in Benzes
I must report that we import the narcotics you bought it
(Then talked about it when crack hit the speakers, the music business
I blow up every time we throw up a record
Depending on what you expecting, I'm sure it's bigger than your religion
Perfected by niggas that manifested music to live in)
[Hook]
[Verse 5: Dre]
So tell that gangster throw his set high
Roll it up in a blunt, I'mma take you on the next high
I did exactly what I wanted that's what made them checks fly
In my direction, you never questioned when I said I
Would be a mogul before I visit 2Pac and Left-eye
Eazy and Aaliyah when I see you we gon' test drive
A Lambo in heaven but for now I'm on the redeye
Flying back to my city cuz I'll forever standby
[Hook]
[Verse 6: Kendrick]
Now we can all celebrate
We can all harvest the rap artists of NWA
America target our rap market, it's controversy and hate
Harsh realities we in made our music translate
To the coke dealers, the hood rich, and the broke niggas that play
With them gorillas that know killers that know where you stay
Roll that kush, crack that case, ten bottles of rozay
This was brought to you by Dre
Now every motherfucker in here say:
"Look who's responsible for taking Compton international
I make 'em holla"
[Outro]
Ain't no city quite like mine, yeah
In the city of Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine
Smoking weed with you
Cause you taught me to
Smoking weed with you
Cause you taught me to
Smoking weed with you
Cause you taught me to...
Every morning when I wake up, uh, money on my mind
Good times and to get caked up, uh, sunshine coming through my blinds

Everybody wanna visit for (Women, weed and weather)

Still everybody gotta build for that, me? I make mills off that
How the fuck y'all can't see I ride, when I drive, down the block and
You look outside, H-A-T-E in your eyes, I enter big money for the enterprise
It's a beautiful day I guess for a bitch to roll with Andre I guess
Roll it up, baby come lift that dress then roll it up for me when I'm stressed
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss

But nothing like my hometown I'm forever living

Some, three W's only for a three day run, bitch
Take them motherfuckin' panties off, you ain't no. nun, shit
I be living in the sky everytime I ride by them hoes
Ribbon in the sky on the radio cause Stevie know I control
Let it breathe, I control, California living 'til I am old
You want to be one, to peak on the chart
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
She in the coupe, she in the Neon cause she on the BS before we can start
Fuck with a nigga, ride with a nigga, let 'em know the priority order me
Hennessey and for my niggas OG Killa, call it Jason Voorhees
Boy he's on his job, boy he sure be having the marks on they mark
Pretty bitches and tire marks, let 'em inhale them pipe exhausts
Let 'em reveal how much it cost for this life controlling my vice
No way hell no, uh uh, if I'm wrong I don't wanna be right
We want to be one, to peak on the chart
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
Women, weed, weather, it's not my fault
That it's 82 degrees and my top peeled off
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas I be screwed up, Chi town I be really pimping
But nothing like my hometown I'm forever living

And I know that I'm in a position of controlling, anything, I by that ocean
I'm a boss I'll buy that ocean, ain't nobody fucking with this
They want that shit, they often feind, I give it to ‘em, but in between
My time, I gotta tie shoestrings, life's a trip when you want these things
I often slip and then I lean toward three W's in life
You know blow job need an application, eating pussy make appetite
And yeah my type, I like 'em brown, just like my drink, the fuck you think
I don't fuck with no hand me downs, see if you fuck then it's after me
You know how much I'mma make it work?
You know her dress slip it in her purse
When you discussed your love for lust, just make sure you visit here first, Cali
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas I be screwed up, Chi town I be really pimping
But nothing like my hometown I'm forever living
Women, weed and weather
(They come for) women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
(From all around the world for the) women, weed and weather
Got that women, weed and weather
Don't it sound clever, come and play
What more can I say? Welcome to LA
Smoking weed with you
Cause you taught me to
Smoking weed with you
Cause you taught me to
Smoking weed with you
Cause you taught me to
Smoking weed with you
Cause you taught me to
Smoking weed with you
Cause you taught me to
Smoking weed with you
Cause you taught me to...
Some saying "What up what up. Nigga you made it."
Some saying "What up what up. Nigga you made it."
Some saying "What up what up. Nigga you made it."
So I'm saying "What up what up. Nigga I hate it."
So I'm saying "What up what up. Nigga I hate it."
Frustrated and I'm riding down the back streets
Making my conscious ask me
"Would I survive to make it up out this hole in time?"
Black boy fly
Black boy fly
Black-black boy fly
Black boy fly
I used to be jealous of Aaron Afflalo
I used to be jealous of Aaron Afflalo
He was the one to follow
He was the only leader foreseeing brighter tomorrows
He would live in the gym
We was living in sorrow
Total envy of him
He made a dream become a reality
Actually making it possible to swim
His way up out of Compton with further more to accomplish
Graduate with honors, a sponsor of basketball scholars
It's 2004 and I'm watching him score 30
Remember vividly how them victory points had hurt me
Cause every basket was a reaction or a reminder
That we was just moving backwards
The bungalow where you find us
The art of us ditching classes heading nowhere fast
Stick my head inside the study hall, he focused on math
Determination ambition, plus dedication and wisdom
Qualities he was given was the shit we didn't have
Dug inside of his book bag and Coach Palmer asked for his finals
He had his back like a spinal meanwhile
We singing the same old song spinning the vinyl
11 graders gone wrong
He focused on the NBA we focused on some Patron
Now watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly
Watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly
Watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly
Watch that black boy fly
Black boy
I used to jealous of Jayceon
I used to jealous of Jayceon - Taylor when I was young
Taylor made a career out of music from writing songs
A Buick had driven past bumping him when I mowed the lawn
Money laundering hustling, homies pondering up against
Schemes to make a million even if doing you harm
War's the case and just in case you wasn't alarmed
The city had fought with firearms and many had died before dawn
Its 2004 and I'm hearing the people roar
For the name of The Game they line in front of the store
Swap meets selling our mixtapes I'm like oh shit, wait
Don't wanna be another nigga stuck regretting mistakes
Mixed feelings was my opinion I was defending my insecurities
Chillin my conscience next to a villain
Compton made you believe success wasn't real
Be honest, none of us knew of a record deal
So as I peel through these lottery tickets
I see a Harley Davidson truck visit the same plaza we shopped
A tall nigga hopped out with Jordans and a white tank top
He was top of the rap game, we was the top of the block
So watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly
Watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly
Watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly
Watch that black boy fly
Black boy
My mama didn't raise me up to be jealous-hearted
Like most of the winners call it
Regardless of where you stay, hold your head and continue marching
That's what she said but in my head I wanted to be like Jordan
A Boy touring the country with money from mic recording
The only way out the ghetto, you know the stereotype
Shooting hoops or live on the stereo like top 40
And shortly, I got discouraged
Like every time I walked to the corner had them guns bursting
Nigga, I was rehearsing in repetition the phrase
Only one in a million will ever see better days
Especially when the crime waves was bigger than tsunamis
Break your boogie boards to pieces you just a typical homy
All these niggas facetious and they all standing beside me
They all will buy me a chopper if any one of you try me
What am I to do when every neighborhood is an obstacle
When 2 niggas making it out had never sounded logical
3 niggas making it out, that's mission impossible
So I never believed the type of performance that I could do
I wasn't jealous cuz of the talents they got
I was terrified they'll be the last black boys to fly...
Out of Compton
Thank God...
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
We on?
Aight
1, 2, 3, go!
Waking up in a dream
Sleepwalking on another big stage
You never heard peace 'til you hear people scream
Your name and your song, I'm so far away
From the place I used to be, struggling usually
Look at the newer me, fate pursuing me
I can feel the energy in the air
It feel like I'm supposed to here
Everywhere I go I'm getting so much love
Fans, the stars, everyone
Sayin how they can't wait for the LP
And I'm gonna blow
They believe in me
Feel so good in what you do
Helps somebody else get through
That's why I do the best I can
Because I know how blessed I am
I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better
A fool if I take it all for granted
A smart man if I keep my feet planted
To the earth cause the people that hurt can understand it
You speakin' outlandish
I'mma show you how to make it all work
Another plan, it a short term goal for me
A reconcile for me
It's just more of and me and you're here
For you to hear Kendrick persevere
Defenses I feel relentless
And visual with a clear vision
Takin' off I ain't takin off these Pistons
I'm takin' off on the inner me - you're distance
Came across me, how much it'a cost me
To get you out my business
I set a plan, it's a short term goal, no sky is the limit
I'm past that, now pass that
Award, not one but four
Times two plus yours
I see myself performing there (K.dot)
Sold out shows where the room is packed
Sitting at the Grammy's winning five awards
See myself on big billboards
Traveling around the world with endorsement deals
Can't imagine how it feels
That's why I'm smiling everyday
Because my dream ain't far away
I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better
You looking at me and you tell me I'm blessed
Calculated my steps, my heart, my breath
Breathe hums? of a victory and vividly
You see me when at my best, my worst
This dedicated to the days that I slept
With a curse research my paid dues I'm reimbursed
I burst in the crowd with a voice and crown
I'm a King on the prowl and I (seem I'm a smile)?
And I vow on the tape that I'll never break
You can break bread with me now
We can all take a bow on the edge of the pedestal
Then scream out loud that we made it off the avenue
And walked that mile
In the darkness I often sit back
And get lost in the rap that I wrote
When you told me that it spoke to your soul
I was talking to you
I was walking it through every ghetto
Tell success hello
We here
And I'm so happy I cry
Cause I can't believe
All the things I ever wanted
Are finally happening for me
And it's so surreal
That I almost feel
Any minute I can wake up
From this fantasy
When you pray so hard
And you've come so far
And you know that it's the time for you lift your?
And I'm gunna do it
Watch me
I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better
I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better
F*ck Black hippy nigga, I invented the recipe
It's a beautiful day I guess for a bitch to roll with Ab-Soul I guess
Pretty Chick let me see them breast, E.T. OG from the weed clinic (Soulo)
Solo but I'm never alone (that's right), I stay high and I'm powerful (Soulo)
Westside (easy call) I got three eyes man I see y'all
All I do is kill shit ICU, party with a few girls at USC
It's 82 degrees and my top off, and they top off, I'm getting topped off, Top Dawg
Women, weed, and weather what more can I say, to live and die in LA
Spend a week on Venice beach - I'm 2Pac and Biggie Smalls
Every morning nigga I get blazed (aye); women, weed, and weather nigga if you bored
Come and join the wave (aye); girl, what is your name
Cause I'm feeling your frame, can I see what you bout (uh); a little something in your rear
Little something in your mouth, little something on your couch (uh); know now what I'm talkin' about, bring the coffin out
Cause I killed it, I done drilled it, she said she like it from the back like a real bitch (uh)
She swallowed my pride, I damn near cried
Yo, I can't reply, she curled my toes and crossed my eyes
But when you got the recipe its no surprise, bad hoes panties get left behind - I want your behind
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas I be screwed up, Chi town I be really pimping
But nothing like my hometown I'm forever living
Women, weed and weather (they come for) women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather (from all around the world for the) women, weed and weather

Ribbon in the sky on the radio cause Stevie know I control
Let it breathe, I control, California living 'til I am old
You want to be one, to peak on the chart, so the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
She in the coupe, she in the Neon cause she on the BS before we can start
F*ck with a nigga, ride with a nigga, let 'em know the priority order me
Hennessy and for my niggas OG Killa, call it Jason Voorhees

Pretty bitches and tire marks, let 'em inhale them pipe exhausts
Let 'em reveal how much it cost for this life controlling my vice
No way hell no, uh uh, if I'm wrong I don't wanna be right
We want to be one, to peak on the chart, so the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
Women, weed, weather, it's not my fault, then it's 82 degrees and my top peeled, off
Jay Rock got the recipe, fly hoes wanna roll I guess (I guess)

Lord God
I come to you a sinner
And I humbly repent for my sins
I believe that Jesus is Lord
I believe that you raised him from the dead
I will ask that Jesus will come to my life
And be my Lord and Savior
I receive Jesus to take control of my life
And that I may live for him from this day forth
Thank you Lord Jesus for saving me with your precious blood
In Jesus' name, Amen
I met her at this house party on El Segundo and Central
She had the credentials of strippers in Atlanta
Ass came with a hump from the jump she was a camel
I want to ride like Arabians, push an '04 Mercedes-Benz
"Hello my name is Kendrick," she said "No, you're handsome"
Whispered in my ear, disappeared then found her dancing
Ciara had played in the background
The parade music we made had us all wearing shades now (Cool)
"Where you stay?" She said "Down the street from Dominguez High"
Okay, I know that's borderline Compton or Paramount
"Well is it Compton?"
"No," she replied and quickly start batting her eyes and
Strictly had wanted her thighs around me
Seventeen, with nothing but pussy stuck on my mental
My motive was rather sinful
"What you trying to get into?"
She didn't tell, just gave me her Nextel
Dropped the number, we chirped the whole summer and well
The summer had passed and now I'm liking her
Conversation we having probably enticing her
Who could imagine, maybe my actions would end up wifing her
Love or lust, regardless we'll fuck cause the trife in us
It's deep rooted, the music of being young and dumb
Its never muted, in fact it's much louder where I'm from
We know a lot 'bout each other, her mother was a crack addict
She live with her granny and her younger two brothers
Her favorite cousin Demetrius's irrepetible
Family history of gang banging - did make me skeptical
But not enough to stop me from getting a nut
I wanna come over, what's up? That's what I told her soon as this episode
Of Martin go off, I'm trying to get off
I was in heat like a cactus, my tactics of being thirsty
Probably could hurt me, but fuck it I got some heart
Grab my momma's keys, hopped in the car, then oh boy
So now I'm down Rosecrans in a Caravan
Passing Alameda, my gas meter in need of a pump
I got enough to get me through the traffic jam
At least I hope cause my pockets broke as a promise man
I'm thinking bout that sex, thinking bout her thighs
Or maybe kissing on her neck, or maybe what positions next
Sent a picture of her titties blowing up my texts
I looked at 'em and almost ran my front bumper into Corvette
Enthused by the touch of a woman, she's a masseuse
And I'm a professional porn star when off the Goose
I had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransom
I'm hoping to get her loose like an Uncle Luke Anthem
I'm two blocks away, 250 feet
And six steps from where she stay, she waving me 'cross the street
I pulled up a smile on my face, and then I see
Two niggas, two black hoodies, I froze as my phone rang
Please leave your message for 323-
Record your message after the tone

Who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me

Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe

I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you to me is painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hanging with ya
Fell on my face and I woke with a scar
Another mistake living deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me then put me on stages
To me that's amazing
To you that's a quick check, with all disrespect let me say this
I am a sinner
Who is probably going to sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe

Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
I'm trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
You trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I'm looking right past ya
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know this is something you can blame
On yourself you can remain, stuck in a box
Ima break out and then hide every lock
Ima break out and then hide every lock
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me then put me on stages
To me that's amazing
To you that's a quick check, with all disrespect let me say this
I am a sinner
Who is probably going to sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone

Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
You ain't heard the Coast like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line
And they waiting on Kendrick like the 1st and the 15th
3's in the air I can see you are - in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings now what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My new year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfucking much, I got my drink I got my music
I say, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Martin had a dream
Martin had a dream

All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for 72 hours
God damn I feel amazing, damn I'm in the matrix
My mind is living on cloud 9 and this 9 is never on vacation
Start up that Maserati and VROOM VROOM!
I'm racing
Poppin pills in the lobby and I pray they don't find her naked
And I pray you niggas is hating, shooters go after Judas
Jesus Christ if I live life on my knees, ain't no need to do this
Park it in front of Lueders, next to that Church's Chicken
All you pussies is losers, all my niggas is winners, screaming
Goddamn I got bitches
(okay!) damn I got bitches (okay!)
Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I've got 25 lighters on my dresser, yes sir
Put fire to that ass body cast on a stretcher
And her body got that ass that a ruler couldn't measure
And it make me cum fast but I never get embarrassed
And I recognize you have what I've been wanting since that record
That Adina Howard had pop it fast to impress her
She rollin' I'm holding my scrotum imposing
This voice here is golden so fuck y'all I goes in and
Damn I got bitches, damn I got
bitches
Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or nigga... It's go time!!!
I roll in dough with a good grind
And I run at ho with a baton
That's a relay race with a bouquet
They say, "
K, you gon' marry mines?"
Beeitch!!! (no way) Beeitch!!! (no way)
Beeitch!!! (no way) Beeitch!!! (okay)
I'm never living life confined
It's a failure even if I'm blind
I can tell ya who, what, when, where how
To sell ya game right on time
Beeitch!!! (go play) Beeitch!!! (go play)
Beeitch!!! (go play) Beeitch!!!

Killing everything from pussy to a mothafuckin' Hit-Boy beat
She pussy poppin' and I got options like an audible, I be

Let it run Ali
Martin had a dream
Martin had a dream
Kendrick have a dream
Everybody, everybody
Everybody
Everybody sit your bitch ass down and listen to this true mothafuckin' story told by Kendrick Lamar on Rosecrans, ya bitch
Smoking on the finest dope
Aye aye aye aye
Drank until I can't no mo'
Aye aye aye aye
Really I'm a sober soul
But I'm with the homies right now
And we ain't asking for no favors
Rush a nigga quick then laugh about it later
Aye aye aye aye
Really I'm a peacemaker
But I'm with the homies right now
And momma used to say
One day, it's gon' burn you out
One day, it's gon' burn you out, out
One day, it's gon' burn you out
One day, it's gon' burn you
I'm with the homies right now
Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota
A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, and orange soda
Janky stash box when the federales roll up
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor
We on the mission for bad bitches and trouble
I hope the universe love you today
‘Cause the energy we bringing sure to carry away
A flock of positive activists and fill the body with hate
If it's necessary
Bumping Jeezy first album looking distracted
Speaking language only we know, you think it's an accent
The windows roll down all I see is a hand pass it
Hotboxing like George Foreman grilling the masses
Of the working world, we pulled up on a bunch of working girls
And asked them what they working with – look at me
I got the blunt in my mouth
Usually I'm drug-free, but shit I'm with the homies
(Yea nigga, we off a pill and Remy Red
Come through and bust ya head nigga)
Me and the homies
(Sag all the way to the liquor store
Where my niggas pour up 4 and get twisted some more)
Me and the homies
(I ride for my mothafuckin' niggas
Hop out, do my stuff, then hop back in)
Me and the homies
(Matter fact, I hop out that mothafucka and be like
"Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo!...Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo!")
It's 2: 30 and the sun is beaming
Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screaming
Hungry for anything unhealthy and if nutrition can help me
I'll tell you to suck my dick then I'll continue eating
We speeding on the 405 passing Westchester
You know the light skin girls in all the little dresses, good Lord
They knew we weren't from ‘round there
‘Cause every time we down there we pulling out the Boost Mobile sim cards
Bougie bitches with no extensions
Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination
Before we sparked a conversation
We seen three niggas in colors we didn't like then started interrogating
I never was a gangbanger, I mean I was never stranger to the folk neither
I really doubt it
Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it
That's ironic ‘cause I've never been violent, until I'm with the homies
(Just ridin', just ridin')
Me and the homies
(Bullshittin', actin' a fool)
Me and the homies
(Trippin', really trippin')
Me and the homies
(Just ridin', just ridin', just ridin'…)
Bragging ‘bout the episode we just had
A shot of Hennessey didn't make me feel that bad
I'm usually a true firm believer of bad karma
Consequences from evil will make your past haunt you
We tryna conquer the city with disobedience
Quick to turn it up, even if we ain't got the CD in
But Jeezy still playing and our attitude is still "nigga, what is you saying"
Pull in front of the house that we been camping out for like two months
The sun is going down as we take whatever we want
(Ay, ay, nigga cash out, pop the safe
Ay nigga, I think it's somebody in this room
Wait, what?
Nigga, it's somebody in this room!)
I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo
DVDs, plasma screen TVs in the trunk
We made a right, then made a left made a right
Then made a left, we was just circling life
My mama called – "Hello? What you doin'? "Kicking it"
I should've told her I'm probably ‘bout to catch my first offense with the homies
But they made a right, they made a left then made a right
Then another right
One lucky night with the homies
K. Dot, you faded, hood?
Yea we finally got that nigga faded. I think he hit the wrong blunt though
Ooh, which one?
Well which one he talking 'bout? I was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it
I prayed he hit that
Nah, that nigga straight. He ain't hit that one
Got the shenanigans? Give that nigga the shenanigans
Nigga I think we should push back to the city, fo real doe
Nigga, for what?
What that nigga, what's that Jeezy song say nigga?
"Last time I checked I was the man on these streets!"
Yea, yea, that shit right there. I'm tryna be the nigga in the street
There he go. Man you don't even know how the shit go
Look, here's the plan??. We gon' use the kickback as a alibi
Wait 'til the sun go down, roll out, complete the mission, drop K. Dot off at his mama van, at the park, cause I know he tryna fuck on Sherane tonight
Then we all gon' meet back at the block at about 10: 30
That's straight but we should meet up around 12; I'm tryna fuck on something too
Nigga sit yo dumb ass back down, nigga you ain't doing shit tonight
Matter fact, nigga get in the mothafuckin' car. We finna get active
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Me and my niggas tryna get it you bitch
Hit this house lick tell me is you with it you bitch
Home invasion was persuasive
From nine to five I know its vacant you bitch
Dreams of living life like rappers do
Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool
I fucked Sherene then went to tell my bros
Then Usher Raymond "Let it Burn" came on
Hot sauce in my Top Ramen, ya bitch
Parked the car and then we started rhyming, ya bitch
The only thing we had to free our mind
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs
You looking like an easy come up you bitch
A silver spoon I know you come from you bitch
And that's a lifestyle that we never knew
Go at a reverend for the revenue
[Hook]
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison tell me what you doEverybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
And I been hustlin' all day, this a way, that a way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel
A dollar might, just fuck your main bitch that's just how I feel
A dollar might, say fuck them niggas that you came with that's just how I feel
A dollar might, just make that lane switch that's just how I feel
A dollar might, turn to a million and we all rich that's just how I feel
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Dreams of living life like rappers do
Bump that new E-40 after school
You know big ballin with my homies
Earl Stevens had us thinking rational
Back to reality we pour
Another casualty of war
Two bullets in my uncle tony head
He said one day I'd be on tour
That Louie's Burger never be the same
A louis belt will never ease that pain
But I'mma purchase when that day is jerkin'
Pull off at Church's with Pirelli's skirtin'
Gang signs out the window
Hoping all of em offend you
They say your hood is a pot of gold
And we gone crash it when nobodies home
[Hook]
[Unknown Girl Sings]
Be the last one out to get this dough? , No Way
Love one of you bucket headed hoes?, No Way
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No Way
Hit the brakes, when they on patrol..No Way. [2x]
[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
Imagine Rock up in the projects
Where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings
Liquor spilling pistols popping
Baking soda YOLA whipping
Ain't no turkey on Thanksgiving
My homeboy just domed a nigga
I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue
Everyday I'm hustling
What else is a thug to do?
When you eatin' cheese from the government
Gotta provide for my daughter 'n'em
Get the fuck up out my way, bitch
Got that drum and got them bass
Just like a parade, bitch
Drop that work up in the bush
And just hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do tell the truth
This the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut
Them serpents lurking blood
Bitches selling pussy, niggas selling drugs
But it's all good
Broken promise sister you're watching tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a footlocker is
In the streets with a heater under my dungarees
Dreams of me getting shaded under a money tree
[Intro]
Every second, every minute, man I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch put your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now, put me in the mood
I'm talking 'bout dark room, perfume
Go, go!
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I recognize your fragrance (hol' up!)
You ain't never gotta say shit (woo!)
And I know your taste is
A little bit (mmm) high maintenance (ooh)
Everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it ?
I mean write poems in these songs dedicated to you
And you're in the mood for empathy, theres blood in my pen
Better yet when your friends and them
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and
Y'all curled in that little bitty range I heard that
She wanna go and party, She wanna go and party
Nigga don't approach her with that Atari
Nigga that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation, rule a nation, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs
'less I write it down for real, P.S
[Hook x2: Kendrick Lamar]
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just know just know just know just know just
What you want, Poetic Justice, put it in a song
[Verse 2: Drake]
I really hope you play this
Cause ol' girl you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs and all these one off vacations
You've been taken
Clearly a lot for me to take in
It don't make sense
Young East African Girl, you too busy fucking with your other man
I was trying to put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your mama to the motherland
I could do it, maybe one day
When you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's all right here in the city
And you don't run from where we come from
That sound like Poetic Justice, Poetic Justice
You were so new to this life but God damn you got adjusted
I mean I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin, and your big ass in that sundress (ooh!)
Good God, what you doing that walk for?
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
And they say communication saves relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write them down for real
P.S...
[Hook]
[Verse 3 : Kendrick Lamar]
Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Making sure my punctuation curve
Every letter is true
Living my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talking poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it ?
I mean you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb, It's you looking in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, It's you looking poor maybe
Call me crazy, We can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common
And what we have common is pain
I mean you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb and I can see power steering
Sex drive when you swerve, I want that interference
It's coherent, I can hear it, mmhmm
That's your heartbeat
It either caught me or it called me, mmhmm
Breathe slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly
And right before you go blind
P.S.....
[Hook]
[Skit]
"I'm gon' ask you one more time homie, where is you from? Or it is a problem"
"Ay you over here for Sherane homie?"
"Yo I don't care who this nigga over here for, if he don't tell where he come, it's a wrap! I'm sorry"
"Hol' up hol' up hol' up, we gon' do it like this, OK? I'mma tell you where I'm from, you gon' tell me where you from, OK? Or where your Grandma stay, where your mama stay, or where your daddy stay, OK?"
"Enough with all this talkin"
"Matter of fact, get out the van homie. Get out the car before I snatch you out that mother fucker homie"
Mass hallucination baby
Ill education baby
Want to reconnect with your elations
This is your station baby
Look inside these walls and you see them having withdrawals
Of a prisoner on his way
Trapped inside your desire
To fire bullets that stray
Track a tire just tell you I'm tired and ran away
I should ask a choir what do you require
To sing a song that acquire me to have faith
As the record spin I should pray
For the record I recognize that I'm easily prey
I got ate alive yesterday
I got animosity building
It's probably big as a building
Me jumping off of the roof
Is me just playing it safe
But what am I supposed to do
When the topic is red or blue
And you understand that I ain't
But know I'm accustomed to
Just a couple that look for trouble
And live in the street with rank
No better picture to paint than me walking from bible study
And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face
From a function that tooken place
They was wondering if I bang
Step on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks
I don't mind because one day you respect
The good kid, m.A.A.d. city
Mass hallucination baby
Ill education baby
Want to reconnect with your elations
This is your station baby
All I see is strobe lights
Blinding me in my hindsight
Finding me by myself
Promise me you can help
In all honesty I got time to be copacetic
Until you have finally made a decision to hold me against my will
It was like a head on collision that folded me standing still
I can never pick out the difference
And grade a cop on the bill
Every time you clock in the morning
I feel you just want to kill
All my innocence while ignoring my purpose
To persevere as a better person
I know you heard this and probably in fear
But what am I supposed to do
With the blinking of red and blue
Flash from the top of your roof
And your dog has to say woof
And you ask "lift up your shirt"
Cause you wonder if a tattoo
Of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
Gang files, but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile
I heard them chatter: "He's probably young but I know that he's down"
Step on his neck as hard as your bullet proof vest
He don't mind, he know we never respect
The good kid, m.A.A.d. city
Mass hallucination baby
Ill education baby
Want to reconnect with your elations
This is your station baby
All I see in this room
20 Xanies and these 'shrooms
Grown-up candy for pain
Can we live in the same society
It's entirely stressful upon my brain
You hired me as a victim
I quietly hope for change
When violence is the rhythm
Inspired me to obtain
The silence in this room
With 20 Xanies and 'shrooms
Some grown-up candy I lost it
I feel it's nothing to lose
The streets sure to release the worst side of my best
Don't mind, cause now you ever in debt
To good kid, m.A.A.d. city
Mass hallucination baby
Ill education baby
Want to reconnect with your elations
This is your station baby
[Intro/Bridge]If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street I hear
[ScHoolBoy Q]
"YACK! YACK! YACK! YACK!"
[Hook]
"Man down
Where you from, nigga?"
"Fuck who you know, where you from my nigga?"
"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"
This m.A.A.d city like, "Run, my nigga."
[Verse 1]
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin crack or move cocaine
This is cul de sac and plenty congnac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin on your brain
It was Me, O-Boog[?], and Yaya[?] watchin Lucky ride down Rosecrantz
It got ugly, wavin yo hand out the window. Check yo self
Uh, warriors and Conans
Hope euphoria can slow dance with society
The driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand, where --- hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder saying that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin at him different
That was back when I was nine
Joey packed the nine
Packed to stand on every porch was fine
We adapt to crime, pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin for if you ain't walkin up?
You fuckin punk, pickin up the fuckin pump
Pickin off you suckers, suck a dick or die or sucker punch
Or warn the bullets comin from
AK's,AR's,"aye y'all. Duck."
That's what momma said when we was eatin the free lunch
Aw man, God damn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94. Fuck yo truce
Now crawl yo head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just pieces
BG's up to pre-approve, bodies on top of bodies
IV's on top of IV's
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trollie
Make sure your colors correct
Make sure you're cornbread, or they'll be callin your mother collect
They say the governor collect, all of our taxes except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin backwards if you suggest that you sleep wit a Teck
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess
M.A.A.d city
[Hook]
"Man down
Where you from, nigga?"
"Fuck who you know, where you from my nigga?"
"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"
This m.A.A.d city like, "Run, my nigga."
[Intro/Bridge]
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street I hear
[ScHoolBoy Q]
"YACK! YACK! YACK!---
(static)
[MC Eiht]
Wake yo punk ass up!
It ain't nothin but a Compton thang
Chyea
Real simple and plain
I'mma teach you some lessons about the street
It ain't nothin but a Compton thang
Chyea
How we do
[Verse 2]
Fresh outta school cause I was a high school grad
Sleeping in the living room in my momma's pad
Reality struck I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole two nigga's hopped out on foot and dahsed
My Pops said I needed a job I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leaving
In fact I got fired because I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I really don't smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foaming at the mouth
I was straight tweaking the next weekend we broke even
I made a legion then made a promise to see you bleeding
You know the reasons but still won't ever know my life
Kendrick AKA Compton's human sacrifice
[Mc Eight]
Cocaine, weed
Nigga's been mixing shit since the 80's loc
Shine sticks, buck nakeds
Make a nigga flip
Coke heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alandra, Rosecrants, Bullice
I'm still in the hood
Loc yeah that's cool
The hood took me under so I follow the rules
But yeah that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doing the same thing
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately
Couple of IV's with the fucking spraycan
Shots in the crowd then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, harsh turn brave
Mount up regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip
Trip, we in the hood still
So loc, grab a strap cause yeah, it's so real
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and 10 grand's where motherfuckers stand
[Kendrick Lamar]
If I told you I killed a nigga at 16, would you believe me?
Or see me to be innocent Kendrick that you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now & Laters to eat
If I'm mashing all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of being a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the corners like hostage
Kill them all if they gossip, the Children of the Corn
They realizing the option of living a lie, drive they body with toxins
Constantly drinking and drive, hit the power then watch this flame
That arrive in his eye; this a coward, the concept is aim and
They bang it and slide out that bitch with the pies
And the price on his head, the tots probably go to the projects
I live inside the belly of the rough
Compton, U.S.A. made Me an Angel on Angel Dust, what
Pour up, dank, head shot, dank
Sit down, dank, stand up, dank
Pass out, dank, wake up, dank
Faded, dank, faded, dank
Now I done grew up 'round some people living their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask, back stroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels, some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in the dark room, loud tunes, looking to make a vow soon
That I'mma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup, I see the crowd mood
Changing by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me:
Nigga why you babysittin only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it
Pour up, dank, head shot, dank
Sit down, dank, stand up, dank
Pass out, dank, wake up, dank
Faded, dank, faded, dank
Okay, now open your mind up and listen to me, Kendrick
I'm your conscience, if you do not hear me, then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now and I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down I'mma drown in some poison abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes
I see the feelin', the freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrive
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice
Then apparently, I'm over influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most then someone said to me
Nigga why you babysittin only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it
Pour up, dank, head shot, dank
Sit down, dank, stand up, dank
Pass out, dank, wake up, dank
Faded, dank, faded, dank
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out. Do you; bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you, bang
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
Nigga why you babysittin only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it
Pour up, dank, head shot, dank
Sit down, dank, stand up, dank
Pass out, dank, wake up, dank
Faded, dank, faded, dank
Aw man, what is she taking?
Where is she taking
All I, all I, all I, all I, all I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got Hunger pain that grow insane, tell me do that sound familiar?
If it do then you're like me, making excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release everything that corrode inside of me
I see you joking, why you laugh? don't you feel bad?
I probably sleep and never ever wake up
Never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust
But just when I thought I had enough
When the lights shut off
And its my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off
And its my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow
I'm hoping that I can borrow a piece of mind
I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright
And a fight he tried to put up, but the type
Of bullet that stuck had went against his will
As blood spilled on your hands
My plans rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back whispering, "Get em"
I got em, and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality that told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover
A passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a young'n
In pajamas and Dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs
Dumb niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child
I'm proud and well devoted
This piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'mma push it, wherever whenever
And I love you cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop I hope
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off
And its my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it "Section .80," the message resemble "Brenda's Got a Baby"
Whats crazy was, I was hearin about it
But doubted your ignorance, how could you ever
Just put her on blast and shit
Judging her past and shit
Well it's completely my future
A nigga behind me right now asking for ass and shit
And I'mma need that 40 dollars even if I gotta
Fuck, suck and swallow in the parking lot
Gonzales Park, I'm followed by a married man, a father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tingling keys
Matter of fact he my favorite cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get em back
To where they used to be then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman, or better yet a leader
You need her to learn something, then you probably need to beat her
That's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted
But fuck that "Sorry for your loss" shit
My sister died in vain, but what point are you trying to gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait
Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
Cause I don't need the attention bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away
I know my fate, and I'm on the grind for this cake
I'mma get or die trying, I'm eyeing every male gender with intentions of buying
You lying to these motherfuckers, talking about you can help with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me nigga, fuck your glory nigga, this bullshit...
When the lights shut off
And its my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off
And its my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
Sometimes I look in a mirror and ask myself
Am I really scared of passing away
If it's today I hope I hear a
Cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the holy ghost till it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline
Rake in the scent of a reaper, ensuring that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon
And if I'm doomed, may the wound
Help my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot
And every day the glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about
Cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the scheme of, wondering when I'mma rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
In a direction to speak of something that's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't trying to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like "it need to be told"
Cursing the life of 20 generations after her soul
Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continued rappin
Or steady being distracted by money drugs and four
Fives, I count lives all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fighting for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Now am I worth it?
Did I put enough work in?
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off
And its my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
(Dying of Thirst)
Tired of running
Tired of hunting
My own kind
But retiring nothing
Tires are steady screeching, the driver is rubbing
Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dope on the corner
Look at the coroner
Daughter is dead
Mother is mourning her
Strayed bullets
AK bullets
Resuscitation was waiting patiently but they couldn't
Bring her back
Who got the footage?
Channel 9
Cameras is looking
It's hard to channel your energy when you know you're crooked
Banana clip, split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
How many sins?
I'm running out
How many sins?
I lost count
Dreams of ballin' like Spalding
But only shotty bounce
The reefer calling
I'm cottonmouth
Money is power, yours is ours
Lay with a snitch, die with a coward
Hope we get rich, hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song
A black flower
I'll show you how to
Dye your thirst
Dye your thirst
Dye your thirst
What are we doing?
Who are we fooling?
Hell is hot, fire is proven
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live right just by how to shoot it
Tired of running, s is humming
Tell us to visit, we lying about coming
Now back to business, loading the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is viewed
And the beef is bubbling
It's no discussion, hereditary
All of my cousins
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Too many sins
I'm running out
Somebody send
Me a well for the drought
See, all I know, is taking notes
On taking this life for granted
Granted, if he provoke
My best days, I stress days
(Lord forgive me for all my sins for I not know...)
My best days, I stress days
Say "Fuck the world," my sex slave
Money, pussy and greed; what's my next crave
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
Tired of running, tired of running
Tired of tumbling, tired of running
Tired of tumbling
Back once my momma say
"See a pastor, give me a promise
What if today was the rapture, and you completely tarnished
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dying of thirst
You dying of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works"
(Fuck... I'm tired of this shit.)
(I'm tired of fucking running... Tired of this shit... my brother, homie!)
(Is that what I think that is?!)
(I know that's not what I think that is...)
(Why are you so angry?...)
(See, you young men are dying of thirst. Do you know what that means?)
(That means that you need WATER... HOLY water.)
(You need to baptized with the Spirit of the Lord.)
(Do you want to receive God as your personal savior?)
(Ok... Repeat after me)
(Lord, God, I come to you, a sinner)
(And I humbly repent for my sins.)
(I believe that Jesus is Lord.)
(I believe You raised him from the dead.)
(I would ask that Jesus come into my life)
(And be my Lord, and Savior.)
(I receive Jesus to take control of my life)
(And that I might live for Him from this day forward.)
(Thank you Lord Jesus, for saving me with Your Precious Blood)
(In Jesus' name... Amen)
(Alright now... remember this day.)
[Hook]
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say
When I feel, and I... 
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air
I'm proud to say yea
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really really real *(x4)
[Verse 1] 
I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie even if they tell
Sweet lullabies that come with a smell
Of a dozen roses flippin' down *a green hill
You living in a world that come with plan B
Cause plan A never relay a guarantee
And plan C never could say just what it was
And your plans only can pan around love
You love him, you love them, you love her 
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love red-bottom and gold they say queen
You love hand-bag on the waist of your jean 
You love french tip and trip that pay for 
You love bank slip that tell you we paid more
You love a good hand whenever the card dealt 
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie even if they fell
Out the sky and your optics? turn stale
Where they *mold that's green
I can see you fit the bell
Of living in a world that come with Plan B
Cause Plan A only can make another mistake 
And you can't see success coming from plan C
When it all breaks you, you still say you love me
And love them and love when you love her 
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love fast cars and their present is old
You love fast women
You love keepin' control
Of everything *that you love, you love beef
You love streets, you love runnin', duckin' police
You love your hood, might even love it to death
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
The reason why I know you very well
Cause we have the same eyes can't you tell
The days I tried to cover up and conceal
My pride, it only made it harder for me to deal
When living in a that come with plan B
A scapegoat cause plan A don't come for free
And plan C just an excuse like because
Or the word "but", but what if I got love
I love them, I love when I love her
I love so much, I love when love hurts
I love first verse cause you're the girl I attract
I love second verse cause your the homie they packed
Burning like a stove top, they love cooking from scratch
I love what the both of you have to offer
In fact, I love it so much
I don't love anything else
But what love got to do with it when I don't love myself
To the point I should hate everything I do love
Should I hate living my life inside the club
Should I hate her for watching me for that reason
Should I hate him for telling me that I'm season
Should I hate them for telling me ball out
Should I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about
Hatin' all money, power, respect in my will
I'm hatin' the fact that none of that shit make me real
[Verse 1: Kendrick]
Now everybody serenade the new faith of Kendrick Lamar
This is king Kendrick Lamar
King Kendrick and I meant it, my point intended is raw
Fix your lenses forensics would've told you Kendrick had killed it
Pretend it's a massacre and the masses upon us
And I mastered being the master and dodging your honor
And the chapter that read at 25 I would live dormant like 5 in the morning
Then ring your spot while Kendrick's performing
And if they take everything, know I got
[Hook]
Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine
(Ay, Dre what's happenin' wit' it my nigga!)
[Verse 2: Dre]
Still I'm mad, peel the plastic off it, you can feel the magic
Still I'm laughing at the critics talking, I can see 'em gagging
When I'm back in the back of my city, back in the back
With a batch of them bangin' Dre Beats with me, look where I'm at
It's the murder cap' and I'm captain at birth of this gangsta rap
It's a wrap when I'm done and I come a long way from a hundred dollars a month
To a hundred mil' in a day, bitch I'm from
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Kendrick]
So come and visit the tire screeching, ambulance, policeman
Won't you spend a weekend on Rosecrans nigga
Khaki creasing, crime increasing on Rosecrans nigga
Kendrick Conan nigga
Where you sword at, hand on the cross and swore that
I do it big as Rasputia for them shooters Kama Sutra scream fuck your position and make you hold that
I'm trying to stay grounded like four flats
But I know flats and Piru Crip tats
Will swarm on me like a beehive
Hop in the G ride
From the West to the East side
Know that's just how Compton roll
[Verse 4: Dre (and Kendrick)]
And that's a given
I pass the blunt then pass the torch of course that's my decision
I crash the Porsche then you report that you see me in Benzes
I must report that we import the narcotics you bought it
(Then talked about it when crack hit the speakers, the music business
I blow up every time we throw up a record
Depending on what you expecting, I'm sure it's bigger than your religion
Perfected by niggas that manifested music to live in)
[Hook]
[Verse 5: Dre]
So tell that gangster throw his set high
Roll it up in a blunt, I'mma take you on the next high
I did exactly what I wanted that's what made them checks fly
In my direction, you never questioned when I said I
Would be a mogul before I visit 2Pac and Left-eye
Eazy and Aaliyah when I see you we gon' test drive
A Lambo in heaven but for now I'm on the redeye
Flying back to my city cuz I'll forever standby
[Hook]
[Verse 6: Kendrick]
Now we can all celebrate
We can all harvest the rap artists of NWA
America target our rap market, it's controversy and hate
Harsh realities we in made our music translate
To the coke dealers, the hood rich, and the broke niggas that play
With them gorillas that know killers that know where you stay
Roll that kush, crack that case, ten bottles of rozay
This was brought to you by Dre
Now every motherfucker in here say:
"Look who's responsible for taking Compton international
I make 'em holla"
[Outro]
Ain't no city quite like mine, yeah
In the city of Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine
Smoking weed with you
Cause you taught me to
Smoking weed with you

Smoking weed with you
Cause you taught me to...
Every morning when I wake up, uh, money on my mind
Good times and to get caked up, uh, sunshine coming through my blinds
I'm living but, really though, it's never enough
10 milli on, that's a must, living in California
Everybody wanna visit for (Women, weed and weather)
They come for (Women, weed and weather)
(For the women, weed and weather)
From all around the world for the (Women, weed and weather)
These niggas'll kill for that, put it in your grill for that
Still everybody gotta build for that, me? I make mills off that
How the fuck y'all can't see I ride, when I drive, down the block and
You look outside, H-A-T-E in your eyes, I enter big money for the enterprise
It's a beautiful day I guess for a bitch to roll with Andre I guess
Roll it up, baby come lift that dress then roll it up for me when I'm stressed
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas I be screwed up, Chi town I be really pimping
But nothing like my hometown I'm forever living
Women, weed and weather
(They come for) women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather

Got that women, weed and weather

My nigga said he wanna fly out to get him
Some, three W's only for a three day run, bitch
Take them motherfuckin' panties off, you ain't no. nun, shit
I be living in the sky everytime I ride by them hoes
Ribbon in the sky on the radio cause Stevie know I control
Let it breathe, I control, California living 'til I am old
You want to be one, to peak on the chart
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
She in the coupe, she in the Neon cause she on the BS before we can start
Fuck with a nigga, ride with a nigga, let 'em know the priority order me
Hennessey and for my niggas OG Killa, call it Jason Voorhees
Boy he's on his job, boy he sure be having the marks on they mark
Pretty bitches and tire marks, let 'em inhale them pipe exhausts
Let 'em reveal how much it cost for this life controlling my vice
No way hell no, uh uh, if I'm wrong I don't wanna be right
We want to be one, to peak on the chart
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
Women, weed, weather, it's not my fault
That it's 82 degrees and my top peeled off
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York

That mean she'll fuck 'til the morning, time and I got time
And I know that I'm in a position of controlling, anything, I by that ocean
I'm a boss I'll buy that ocean, ain't nobody fucking with this
They want that shit, they often feind, I give it to ‘em, but in between
My time, I gotta tie shoestrings, life's a trip when you want these things
I often slip and then I lean toward three W's in life
You know blow job need an application, eating pussy make appetite
And yeah my type, I like 'em brown, just like my drink, the fuck you think
I don't fuck with no hand me downs, see if you fuck then it's after me
You know how much I'mma make it work?
You know her dress slip it in her purse
When you discussed your love for lust, just make sure you visit here first, Cali
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas I be screwed up, Chi town I be really pimping
But nothing like my hometown I'm forever living
Women, weed and weather

Cause you taught me to...
Some saying "What up what up. Nigga you made it."
Some saying "What up what up. Nigga you made it."
Some saying "What up what up. Nigga you made it."
So I'm saying "What up what up. Nigga I hate it."
So I'm saying "What up what up. Nigga I hate it."
Frustrated and I'm riding down the back streets
Making my conscious ask me
"Would I survive to make it up out this hole in time?"
Black boy fly
Black boy fly
Black-black boy fly
Black boy fly
I used to be jealous of Aaron Afflalo
I used to be jealous of Aaron Afflalo
He was the one to follow
He was the only leader foreseeing brighter tomorrows
He would live in the gym
We was living in sorrow
Total envy of him
He made a dream become a reality
Actually making it possible to swim
His way up out of Compton with further more to accomplish
Graduate with honors, a sponsor of basketball scholars
It's 2004 and I'm watching him score 30
Remember vividly how them victory points had hurt me
Cause every basket was a reaction or a reminder
That we was just moving backwards
The bungalow where you find us
The art of us ditching classes heading nowhere fast
Stick my head inside the study hall, he focused on math
Determination ambition, plus dedication and wisdom
Qualities he was given was the shit we didn't have
Dug inside of his book bag and Coach Palmer asked for his finals
He had his back like a spinal meanwhile
We singing the same old song spinning the vinyl
11 graders gone wrong
He focused on the NBA we focused on some Patron
Now watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly
Watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly
Watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly
Watch that black boy fly
Black boy
I used to jealous of Jayceon
I used to jealous of Jayceon - Taylor when I was young
Taylor made a career out of music from writing songs
A Buick had driven past bumping him when I mowed the lawn
Money laundering hustling, homies pondering up against
Schemes to make a million even if doing you harm
War's the case and just in case you wasn't alarmed
The city had fought with firearms and many had died before dawn
Its 2004 and I'm hearing the people roar
For the name of The Game they line in front of the store
Swap meets selling our mixtapes I'm like oh shit, wait
Don't wanna be another nigga stuck regretting mistakes
Mixed feelings was my opinion I was defending my insecurities
Chillin my conscience next to a villain
Compton made you believe success wasn't real
Be honest, none of us knew of a record deal
So as I peel through these lottery tickets
I see a Harley Davidson truck visit the same plaza we shopped
A tall nigga hopped out with Jordans and a white tank top
He was top of the rap game, we was the top of the block
So watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly
Watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly
Watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly
Watch that black boy fly
Black boy
My mama didn't raise me up to be jealous-hearted
Like most of the winners call it
Regardless of where you stay, hold your head and continue marching
That's what she said but in my head I wanted to be like Jordan
A Boy touring the country with money from mic recording
The only way out the ghetto, you know the stereotype
Shooting hoops or live on the stereo like top 40
And shortly, I got discouraged
Like every time I walked to the corner had them guns bursting
Nigga, I was rehearsing in repetition the phrase
Only one in a million will ever see better days
Especially when the crime waves was bigger than tsunamis
Break your boogie boards to pieces you just a typical homy
All these niggas facetious and they all standing beside me
They all will buy me a chopper if any one of you try me
What am I to do when every neighborhood is an obstacle
When 2 niggas making it out had never sounded logical
3 niggas making it out, that's mission impossible
So I never believed the type of performance that I could do
I wasn't jealous cuz of the talents they got
I was terrified they'll be the last black boys to fly...
Out of Compton
Thank God...
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
We on?
Aight
1, 2, 3, go!
Waking up in a dream
Sleepwalking on another big stage
You never heard peace 'til you hear people scream
Your name and your song, I'm so far away
From the place I used to be, struggling usually
Look at the newer me, fate pursuing me
I can feel the energy in the air
It feel like I'm supposed to here
Everywhere I go I'm getting so much love
Fans, the stars, everyone
Sayin how they can't wait for the LP
And I'm gonna blow
They believe in me
Feel so good in what you do
Helps somebody else get through
That's why I do the best I can
Because I know how blessed I am
I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better
A fool if I take it all for granted
A smart man if I keep my feet planted
To the earth cause the people that hurt can understand it
You speakin' outlandish
I'mma show you how to make it all work
Another plan, it a short term goal for me
A reconcile for me
It's just more of and me and you're here
For you to hear Kendrick persevere
Defenses I feel relentless
And visual with a clear vision
Takin' off I ain't takin off these Pistons
I'm takin' off on the inner me - you're distance
Came across me, how much it'a cost me
To get you out my business
I set a plan, it's a short term goal, no sky is the limit
I'm past that, now pass that
Award, not one but four
Times two plus yours
I see myself performing there (K.dot)
Sold out shows where the room is packed
Sitting at the Grammy's winning five awards
See myself on big billboards
Traveling around the world with endorsement deals
Can't imagine how it feels
That's why I'm smiling everyday
Because my dream ain't far away
I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better
You looking at me and you tell me I'm blessed
Calculated my steps, my heart, my breath
Breathe hums? of a victory and vividly
You see me when at my best, my worst
This dedicated to the days that I slept
With a curse research my paid dues I'm reimbursed
I burst in the crowd with a voice and crown
I'm a King on the prowl and I (seem I'm a smile)?
And I vow on the tape that I'll never break
You can break bread with me now
We can all take a bow on the edge of the pedestal
Then scream out loud that we made it off the avenue
And walked that mile
In the darkness I often sit back
And get lost in the rap that I wrote
When you told me that it spoke to your soul
I was talking to you
I was walking it through every ghetto
Tell success hello
We here
And I'm so happy I cry
Cause I can't believe
All the things I ever wanted
Are finally happening for me
And it's so surreal
That I almost feel
Any minute I can wake up
From this fantasy
When you pray so hard
And you've come so far
And you know that it's the time for you lift your?
And I'm gunna do it
Watch me
I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better
I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better
F*ck Black hippy nigga, I invented the recipe
It's a beautiful day I guess for a bitch to roll with Ab-Soul I guess
Pretty Chick let me see them breast, E.T. OG from the weed clinic (Soulo)
Solo but I'm never alone (that's right), I stay high and I'm powerful (Soulo)
Westside (easy call) I got three eyes man I see y'all
All I do is kill shit ICU, party with a few girls at USC
It's 82 degrees and my top off, and they top off, I'm getting topped off, Top Dawg
Women, weed, and weather what more can I say, to live and die in LA
Spend a week on Venice beach - I'm 2Pac and Biggie Smalls
Every morning nigga I get blazed (aye); women, weed, and weather nigga if you bored
Come and join the wave (aye); girl, what is your name
Cause I'm feeling your frame, can I see what you bout (uh); a little something in your rear
Little something in your mouth, little something on your couch (uh); know now what I'm talkin' about, bring the coffin out
Cause I killed it, I done drilled it, she said she like it from the back like a real bitch (uh)
She swallowed my pride, I damn near cried
Yo, I can't reply, she curled my toes and crossed my eyes
But when you got the recipe its no surprise, bad hoes panties get left behind - I want your behind
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas I be screwed up, Chi town I be really pimping
But nothing like my hometown I'm forever living
Women, weed and weather (they come for) women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather (from all around the world for the) women, weed and weather
Got that women, weed and weather - don't it sound clever, come and play
Wh-What more can I say? Welcome to LA
My nigga said he wanna fly out to get him, some
Three W's only for a three day, run
Bitch, take them motherf*ckin' panties off, you ain't no, nun (shit)

Ribbon in the sky on the radio cause Stevie know I control
Let it breathe, I control, California living 'til I am old
You want to be one, to peak on the chart, so the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
She in the coupe, she in the Neon cause she on the BS before we can start
F*ck with a nigga, ride with a nigga, let 'em know the priority order me
Hennessy and for my niggas OG Killa, call it Jason Voorhees
Boy he's on his job, boy he sure be having the marks on they mark
Pretty bitches and tire marks, let 'em inhale them pipe exhausts
Let 'em reveal how much it cost for this life controlling my vice
No way hell no, uh uh, if I'm wrong I don't wanna be right
We want to be one, to peak on the chart, so the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts

[Intro: Emeli Sandé & Kendrick Lamar]
You don't know what pain is, you just fuck with famous
I don't know you, I can't tell your energy is dangerous
I don't know how long it took to finally come alive
So bitch don't kill my vibe
Yeah, I can feel the changes, and I can tell you hating
Save your breath I'm sick to death of fake congratulations
You don't know how much I had to give to come alive
So bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes, I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you to me is painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture when the color blind is hanging with you
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake living deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge
[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me then put me on stages
To me that's amazing
To you that's a quick check with all disrespect let me say this
[Hook: Kendrick Lamar & Emeli Sandé]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
You're trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I'm looking right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
To die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know this is something you can blame
On yourselves you can remain stuck in a box
I'm a break out and then hide every lock
I'm a break out and then hide every lock
[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
[Hook: Kendrick Lamar & Emeli Sandé]
[Outro: Kendrick Lamar & Emeli Sandé]
You ain't heard a chorus like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air I can see you are, in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings now what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfucking much, I got my drink I got my music
I say bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Lord God
I come to you a sinner
And I humbly repent for my sins
I believe that Jesus is Lord
I believe that you raised him from the dead
I will ask that Jesus will come to my life
And be my Lord and Savior
I receive Jesus to take control of my life
And that I may live for him from this day forth
Thank you Lord Jesus for saving me with your precious blood
In Jesus' name, Amen
I met her at this house party on El Segundo and Central
She had the credentials of strippers in Atlanta
Ass came with a hump from the jump she was a camel
I want to ride like Arabians, push an '04 Mercedes-Benz
"Hello my name is Kendrick," she said "No, you're handsome"
Whispered in my ear, disappeared then found her dancing
Ciara had played in the background
The parade music we made had us all wearing shades now (Cool)
"Where you stay?" She said "Down the street from Dominguez High"
Okay, I know that's borderline Compton or Paramount
"Well is it Compton?"
"No," she replied and quickly start batting her eyes and
Strictly had wanted her thighs around me
Seventeen, with nothing but pussy stuck on my mental
My motive was rather sinful
"What you trying to get into?"
She didn't tell, just gave me her Nextel
Dropped the number, we chirped the whole summer and well
The summer had passed and now I'm liking her
Conversation we having probably enticing her
Who could imagine, maybe my actions would end up wifing her
Love or lust, regardless we'll fuck cause the trife in us
It's deep rooted, the music of being young and dumb
Its never muted, in fact it's much louder where I'm from
We know a lot 'bout each other, her mother was a crack addict
She live with her granny and her younger two brothers
Her favorite cousin Demetrius's irrepetible
Family history of gang banging - did make me skeptical
But not enough to stop me from getting a nut
I wanna come over, what's up? That's what I told her soon as this episode
Of Martin go off, I'm trying to get off
I was in heat like a cactus, my tactics of being thirsty
Probably could hurt me, but fuck it I got some heart
Grab my momma's keys, hopped in the car, then oh boy
So now I'm down Rosecrans in a Caravan
Passing Alameda, my gas meter in need of a pump
I got enough to get me through the traffic jam
At least I hope cause my pockets broke as a promise man
I'm thinking bout that sex, thinking bout her thighs
Or maybe kissing on her neck, or maybe what positions next
Sent a picture of her titties blowing up my texts
I looked at 'em and almost ran my front bumper into Corvette
Enthused by the touch of a woman, she's a masseuse
And I'm a professional porn star when off the Goose
I had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransom
I'm hoping to get her loose like an Uncle Luke Anthem
I'm two blocks away, 250 feet
And six steps from where she stay, she waving me 'cross the street
I pulled up a smile on my face, and then I see
Two niggas, two black hoodies, I froze as my phone rang
Please leave your message for 323-
Record your message after the tone

You killin' my motherfuckin' vibe
I am a sinner
Who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you to me is painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hanging with ya
Fell on my face and I woke with a scar
Another mistake living deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me then put me on stages
To me that's amazing
To you that's a quick check, with all disrespect let me say this
I am a sinner
Who is probably going to sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
I'm trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
You trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I'm looking right past ya
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know this is something you can blame
On yourself you can remain, stuck in a box
Ima break out and then hide every lock
Ima break out and then hide every lock
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me then put me on stages
To me that's amazing
To you that's a quick check, with all disrespect let me say this
I am a sinner
Who is probably going to sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
You ain't heard the Coast like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line
And they waiting on Kendrick like the 1st and the 15th
3's in the air I can see you are - in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings now what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My new year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfucking much, I got my drink I got my music
I say, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Martin had a dream
Martin had a dream
Kendrick have a dream
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for 72 hours
God damn I feel amazing, damn I'm in the matrix
My mind is living on cloud 9 and this 9 is never on vacation
Start up that Maserati and VROOM VROOM!
I'm racing
Poppin pills in the lobby and I pray they don't find her naked
And I pray you niggas is hating, shooters go after Judas
Jesus Christ if I live life on my knees, ain't no need to do this
Park it in front of Lueders, next to that Church's Chicken
All you pussies is losers, all my niggas is winners, screaming
Goddamn I got bitches
(okay!) damn I got bitches (okay!)
Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I've got 25 lighters on my dresser, yes sir
Put fire to that ass body cast on a stretcher
And her body got that ass that a ruler couldn't measure
And it make me cum fast but I never get embarrassed
And I recognize you have what I've been wanting since that record
That Adina Howard had pop it fast to impress her
She rollin' I'm holding my scrotum imposing
This voice here is golden so fuck y'all I goes in and
Damn I got bitches, damn I got
bitches
Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or nigga... It's go time!!!
I roll in dough with a good grind
And I run at ho with a baton
That's a relay race with a bouquet
They say, "
K, you gon' marry mines?"
Beeitch!!! (no way) Beeitch!!! (no way)
Beeitch!!! (no way) Beeitch!!! (okay)
I'm never living life confined
It's a failure even if I'm blind
I can tell ya who, what, when, where how
To sell ya game right on time
Beeitch!!! (go play) Beeitch!!! (go play)
Beeitch!!! (go play) Beeitch!!!
I look like OJ
Killing everything from pussy to a mothafuckin' Hit-Boy beat
She pussy poppin' and I got options like an audible, I be
C-O-M-P-T-O-N I win then ball at your defeat
C-O-M-P-T-O-N my city mobbin' in the street, yellin'
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for 72 hours
Goddamn I got bitches
Damn I got bitches
Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
Let it run Ali
Martin had a dream
Martin had a dream
Kendrick have a dream
Everybody, everybody
Everybody
Everybody sit your bitch ass down and listen to this true mothafuckin' story told by Kendrick Lamar on Rosecrans, ya bitch
Smoking on the finest dope
Aye aye aye aye
Drank until I can't no mo'
Aye aye aye aye
Really I'm a sober soul
But I'm with the homies right now
And we ain't asking for no favors
Rush a nigga quick then laugh about it later
Aye aye aye aye
Really I'm a peacemaker
But I'm with the homies right now
And momma used to say
One day, it's gon' burn you out
One day, it's gon' burn you out, out
One day, it's gon' burn you out
One day, it's gon' burn you
I'm with the homies right now
Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota
A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, and orange soda
Janky stash box when the federales roll up
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor
We on the mission for bad bitches and trouble
I hope the universe love you today
‘Cause the energy we bringing sure to carry away
A flock of positive activists and fill the body with hate
If it's necessary
Bumping Jeezy first album looking distracted
Speaking language only we know, you think it's an accent
The windows roll down all I see is a hand pass it
Hotboxing like George Foreman grilling the masses
Of the working world, we pulled up on a bunch of working girls
And asked them what they working with – look at me
I got the blunt in my mouth
Usually I'm drug-free, but shit I'm with the homies
(Yea nigga, we off a pill and Remy Red
Come through and bust ya head nigga)
Me and the homies
(Sag all the way to the liquor store
Where my niggas pour up 4 and get twisted some more)
Me and the homies
(I ride for my mothafuckin' niggas
Hop out, do my stuff, then hop back in)
Me and the homies
(Matter fact, I hop out that mothafucka and be like
"Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo!...Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo!")
It's 2: 30 and the sun is beaming
Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screaming
Hungry for anything unhealthy and if nutrition can help me
I'll tell you to suck my dick then I'll continue eating
We speeding on the 405 passing Westchester
You know the light skin girls in all the little dresses, good Lord
They knew we weren't from ‘round there
‘Cause every time we down there we pulling out the Boost Mobile sim cards
Bougie bitches with no extensions
Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination
Before we sparked a conversation
We seen three niggas in colors we didn't like then started interrogating
I never was a gangbanger, I mean I was never stranger to the folk neither
I really doubt it
Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it
That's ironic ‘cause I've never been violent, until I'm with the homies
(Just ridin', just ridin')
Me and the homies
(Bullshittin', actin' a fool)
Me and the homies
(Trippin', really trippin')
Me and the homies
(Just ridin', just ridin', just ridin'…)
Bragging ‘bout the episode we just had
A shot of Hennessey didn't make me feel that bad
I'm usually a true firm believer of bad karma
Consequences from evil will make your past haunt you
We tryna conquer the city with disobedience
Quick to turn it up, even if we ain't got the CD in
But Jeezy still playing and our attitude is still "nigga, what is you saying"
Pull in front of the house that we been camping out for like two months
The sun is going down as we take whatever we want
(Ay, ay, nigga cash out, pop the safe
Ay nigga, I think it's somebody in this room
Wait, what?
Nigga, it's somebody in this room!)
I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo
DVDs, plasma screen TVs in the trunk
We made a right, then made a left made a right
Then made a left, we was just circling life
My mama called – "Hello? What you doin'? "Kicking it"
I should've told her I'm probably ‘bout to catch my first offense with the homies
But they made a right, they made a left then made a right
Then another right
One lucky night with the homies
K. Dot, you faded, hood?
Yea we finally got that nigga faded. I think he hit the wrong blunt though
Ooh, which one?
Well which one he talking 'bout? I was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it
I prayed he hit that
Nah, that nigga straight. He ain't hit that one
Got the shenanigans? Give that nigga the shenanigans
Nigga I think we should push back to the city, fo real doe
Nigga, for what?
What that nigga, what's that Jeezy song say nigga?
"Last time I checked I was the man on these streets!"
Yea, yea, that shit right there. I'm tryna be the nigga in the street
There he go. Man you don't even know how the shit go
Look, here's the plan??. We gon' use the kickback as a alibi
Wait 'til the sun go down, roll out, complete the mission, drop K. Dot off at his mama van, at the park, cause I know he tryna fuck on Sherane tonight
Then we all gon' meet back at the block at about 10: 30
That's straight but we should meet up around 12; I'm tryna fuck on something too
Nigga sit yo dumb ass back down, nigga you ain't doing shit tonight
Matter fact, nigga get in the mothafuckin' car. We finna get active
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Me and my niggas tryna get it you bitch
Hit this house lick tell me is you with it you bitch
Home invasion was persuasive
From nine to five I know its vacant you bitch
Dreams of living life like rappers do
Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool
I fucked Sherene then went to tell my bros
Then Usher Raymond "Let it Burn" came on
Hot sauce in my Top Ramen, ya bitch
Parked the car and then we started rhyming, ya bitch
The only thing we had to free our mind
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs
You looking like an easy come up you bitch
A silver spoon I know you come from you bitch
And that's a lifestyle that we never knew
Go at a reverend for the revenue
[Hook]
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison tell me what you doEverybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
And I been hustlin' all day, this a way, that a way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel
A dollar might, just fuck your main bitch that's just how I feel
A dollar might, say fuck them niggas that you came with that's just how I feel
A dollar might, just make that lane switch that's just how I feel
A dollar might, turn to a million and we all rich that's just how I feel
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Dreams of living life like rappers do
Bump that new E-40 after school
You know big ballin with my homies
Earl Stevens had us thinking rational
Back to reality we pour
Another casualty of war
Two bullets in my uncle tony head
He said one day I'd be on tour
That Louie's Burger never be the same
A louis belt will never ease that pain
But I'mma purchase when that day is jerkin'
Pull off at Church's with Pirelli's skirtin'
Gang signs out the window
Hoping all of em offend you
They say your hood is a pot of gold
And we gone crash it when nobodies home
[Hook]
[Unknown Girl Sings]
Be the last one out to get this dough? , No Way
Love one of you bucket headed hoes?, No Way
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No Way
Hit the brakes, when they on patrol..No Way. [2x]
[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
Imagine Rock up in the projects
Where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings
Liquor spilling pistols popping
Baking soda YOLA whipping
Ain't no turkey on Thanksgiving
My homeboy just domed a nigga
I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue
Everyday I'm hustling
What else is a thug to do?
When you eatin' cheese from the government
Gotta provide for my daughter 'n'em
Get the fuck up out my way, bitch
Got that drum and got them bass
Just like a parade, bitch
Drop that work up in the bush
And just hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do tell the truth
This the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut
Them serpents lurking blood
Bitches selling pussy, niggas selling drugs
But it's all good
Broken promise sister you're watching tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a footlocker is
In the streets with a heater under my dungarees
Dreams of me getting shaded under a money tree
[Intro]
Every second, every minute, man I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch put your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now, put me in the mood
I'm talking 'bout dark room, perfume
Go, go!
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I recognize your fragrance (hol' up!)
You ain't never gotta say shit (woo!)
And I know your taste is
A little bit (mmm) high maintenance (ooh)
Everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it ?
I mean write poems in these songs dedicated to you
And you're in the mood for empathy, theres blood in my pen
Better yet when your friends and them
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and
Y'all curled in that little bitty range I heard that
She wanna go and party, She wanna go and party
Nigga don't approach her with that Atari
Nigga that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation, rule a nation, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs
'less I write it down for real, P.S
[Hook x2: Kendrick Lamar]
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just know just know just know just know just
What you want, Poetic Justice, put it in a song
[Verse 2: Drake]
I really hope you play this
Cause ol' girl you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs and all these one off vacations
You've been taken
Clearly a lot for me to take in
It don't make sense
Young East African Girl, you too busy fucking with your other man
I was trying to put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your mama to the motherland
I could do it, maybe one day
When you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's all right here in the city
And you don't run from where we come from
That sound like Poetic Justice, Poetic Justice
You were so new to this life but God damn you got adjusted
I mean I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin, and your big ass in that sundress (ooh!)
Good God, what you doing that walk for?
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
And they say communication saves relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write them down for real
P.S...
[Hook]
[Verse 3 : Kendrick Lamar]
Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Making sure my punctuation curve
Every letter is true
Living my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talking poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it ?
I mean you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb, It's you looking in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, It's you looking poor maybe
Call me crazy, We can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common
And what we have common is pain
I mean you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb and I can see power steering
Sex drive when you swerve, I want that interference
It's coherent, I can hear it, mmhmm
That's your heartbeat
It either caught me or it called me, mmhmm
Breathe slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly
And right before you go blind
P.S.....
[Hook]
[Skit]
"I'm gon' ask you one more time homie, where is you from? Or it is a problem"
"Ay you over here for Sherane homie?"
"Yo I don't care who this nigga over here for, if he don't tell where he come, it's a wrap! I'm sorry"
"Hol' up hol' up hol' up, we gon' do it like this, OK? I'mma tell you where I'm from, you gon' tell me where you from, OK? Or where your Grandma stay, where your mama stay, or where your daddy stay, OK?"
"Enough with all this talkin"
"Matter of fact, get out the van homie. Get out the car before I snatch you out that mother fucker homie"
Mass hallucination baby
Ill education baby
Want to reconnect with your elations
This is your station baby
Look inside these walls and you see them having withdrawals
Of a prisoner on his way
Trapped inside your desire
To fire bullets that stray
Track a tire just tell you I'm tired and ran away
I should ask a choir what do you require
To sing a song that acquire me to have faith
As the record spin I should pray
For the record I recognize that I'm easily prey
I got ate alive yesterday
I got animosity building
It's probably big as a building
Me jumping off of the roof
Is me just playing it safe
But what am I supposed to do
When the topic is red or blue
And you understand that I ain't
But know I'm accustomed to
Just a couple that look for trouble
And live in the street with rank
No better picture to paint than me walking from bible study
And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face
From a function that tooken place
They was wondering if I bang
Step on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks
I don't mind because one day you respect
The good kid, m.A.A.d. city
Mass hallucination baby
Ill education baby
Want to reconnect with your elations
This is your station baby
All I see is strobe lights
Blinding me in my hindsight
Finding me by myself
Promise me you can help
In all honesty I got time to be copacetic
Until you have finally made a decision to hold me against my will
It was like a head on collision that folded me standing still
I can never pick out the difference
And grade a cop on the bill
Every time you clock in the morning
I feel you just want to kill
All my innocence while ignoring my purpose
To persevere as a better person
I know you heard this and probably in fear
But what am I supposed to do
With the blinking of red and blue
Flash from the top of your roof
And your dog has to say woof
And you ask "lift up your shirt"
Cause you wonder if a tattoo
Of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
Gang files, but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile
I heard them chatter: "He's probably young but I know that he's down"
Step on his neck as hard as your bullet proof vest
He don't mind, he know we never respect
The good kid, m.A.A.d. city
Mass hallucination baby
Ill education baby
Want to reconnect with your elations
This is your station baby
All I see in this room
20 Xanies and these 'shrooms
Grown-up candy for pain
Can we live in the same society
It's entirely stressful upon my brain
You hired me as a victim
I quietly hope for change
When violence is the rhythm
Inspired me to obtain
The silence in this room
With 20 Xanies and 'shrooms
Some grown-up candy I lost it
I feel it's nothing to lose
The streets sure to release the worst side of my best
Don't mind, cause now you ever in debt
To good kid, m.A.A.d. city
Mass hallucination baby
Ill education baby
Want to reconnect with your elations
This is your station baby
[Intro/Bridge]If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street I hear
[ScHoolBoy Q]
"YACK! YACK! YACK! YACK!"
[Hook]
"Man down
Where you from, nigga?"
"Fuck who you know, where you from my nigga?"
"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"
This m.A.A.d city like, "Run, my nigga."
[Verse 1]
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin crack or move cocaine
This is cul de sac and plenty congnac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin on your brain
It was Me, O-Boog[?], and Yaya[?] watchin Lucky ride down Rosecrantz
It got ugly, wavin yo hand out the window. Check yo self
Uh, warriors and Conans
Hope euphoria can slow dance with society
The driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand, where --- hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder saying that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin at him different
That was back when I was nine
Joey packed the nine
Packed to stand on every porch was fine
We adapt to crime, pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin for if you ain't walkin up?
You fuckin punk, pickin up the fuckin pump
Pickin off you suckers, suck a dick or die or sucker punch
Or warn the bullets comin from
AK's,AR's,"aye y'all. Duck."
That's what momma said when we was eatin the free lunch
Aw man, God damn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94. Fuck yo truce
Now crawl yo head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just pieces
BG's up to pre-approve, bodies on top of bodies
IV's on top of IV's
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trollie
Make sure your colors correct
Make sure you're cornbread, or they'll be callin your mother collect
They say the governor collect, all of our taxes except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin backwards if you suggest that you sleep wit a Teck
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess
M.A.A.d city
[Hook]
"Man down
Where you from, nigga?"
"Fuck who you know, where you from my nigga?"
"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"
This m.A.A.d city like, "Run, my nigga."
[Intro/Bridge]
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street I hear
[ScHoolBoy Q]
"YACK! YACK! YACK!---
(static)
[MC Eiht]
Wake yo punk ass up!
It ain't nothin but a Compton thang
Chyea
Real simple and plain
I'mma teach you some lessons about the street
It ain't nothin but a Compton thang
Chyea
How we do
[Verse 2]
Fresh outta school cause I was a high school grad
Sleeping in the living room in my momma's pad
Reality struck I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole two nigga's hopped out on foot and dahsed
My Pops said I needed a job I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leaving
In fact I got fired because I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I really don't smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foaming at the mouth
I was straight tweaking the next weekend we broke even
I made a legion then made a promise to see you bleeding
You know the reasons but still won't ever know my life
Kendrick AKA Compton's human sacrifice
[Mc Eight]
Cocaine, weed
Nigga's been mixing shit since the 80's loc
Shine sticks, buck nakeds
Make a nigga flip
Coke heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alandra, Rosecrants, Bullice
I'm still in the hood
Loc yeah that's cool
The hood took me under so I follow the rules
But yeah that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doing the same thing
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately
Couple of IV's with the fucking spraycan
Shots in the crowd then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, harsh turn brave
Mount up regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip
Trip, we in the hood still
So loc, grab a strap cause yeah, it's so real
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and 10 grand's where motherfuckers stand
[Kendrick Lamar]
If I told you I killed a nigga at 16, would you believe me?
Or see me to be innocent Kendrick that you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now & Laters to eat
If I'm mashing all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of being a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the corners like hostage
Kill them all if they gossip, the Children of the Corn
They realizing the option of living a lie, drive they body with toxins
Constantly drinking and drive, hit the power then watch this flame
That arrive in his eye; this a coward, the concept is aim and
They bang it and slide out that bitch with the pies
And the price on his head, the tots probably go to the projects
I live inside the belly of the rough
Compton, U.S.A. made Me an Angel on Angel Dust, what
Pour up, dank, head shot, dank
Sit down, dank, stand up, dank
Pass out, dank, wake up, dank
Faded, dank, faded, dank
Now I done grew up 'round some people living their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask, back stroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels, some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in the dark room, loud tunes, looking to make a vow soon
That I'mma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup, I see the crowd mood
Changing by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me:
Nigga why you babysittin only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it
Pour up, dank, head shot, dank
Sit down, dank, stand up, dank
Pass out, dank, wake up, dank
Faded, dank, faded, dank
Okay, now open your mind up and listen to me, Kendrick
I'm your conscience, if you do not hear me, then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now and I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down I'mma drown in some poison abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes
I see the feelin', the freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrive
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice
Then apparently, I'm over influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most then someone said to me
Nigga why you babysittin only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it
Pour up, dank, head shot, dank
Sit down, dank, stand up, dank
Pass out, dank, wake up, dank
Faded, dank, faded, dank
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out. Do you; bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you, bang
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
Nigga why you babysittin only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it
Pour up, dank, head shot, dank
Sit down, dank, stand up, dank
Pass out, dank, wake up, dank
Faded, dank, faded, dank
Aw man, what is she taking?
Where is she taking
All I, all I, all I, all I, all I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got Hunger pain that grow insane, tell me do that sound familiar?
If it do then you're like me, making excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release everything that corrode inside of me
I see you joking, why you laugh? don't you feel bad?
I probably sleep and never ever wake up
Never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust
But just when I thought I had enough
When the lights shut off
And its my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off
And its my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow
I'm hoping that I can borrow a piece of mind
I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright
And a fight he tried to put up, but the type
Of bullet that stuck had went against his will
As blood spilled on your hands
My plans rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back whispering, "Get em"
I got em, and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality that told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover
A passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a young'n
In pajamas and Dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs
Dumb niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child
I'm proud and well devoted
This piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'mma push it, wherever whenever
And I love you cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop I hope
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off
And its my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it "Section .80," the message resemble "Brenda's Got a Baby"
Whats crazy was, I was hearin about it
But doubted your ignorance, how could you ever
Just put her on blast and shit
Judging her past and shit
Well it's completely my future
A nigga behind me right now asking for ass and shit
And I'mma need that 40 dollars even if I gotta
Fuck, suck and swallow in the parking lot
Gonzales Park, I'm followed by a married man, a father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tingling keys
Matter of fact he my favorite cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get em back
To where they used to be then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman, or better yet a leader
You need her to learn something, then you probably need to beat her
That's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted
But fuck that "Sorry for your loss" shit
My sister died in vain, but what point are you trying to gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait
Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
Cause I don't need the attention bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away
I know my fate, and I'm on the grind for this cake
I'mma get or die trying, I'm eyeing every male gender with intentions of buying
You lying to these motherfuckers, talking about you can help with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me nigga, fuck your glory nigga, this bullshit...
When the lights shut off
And its my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off
And its my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
Sometimes I look in a mirror and ask myself
Am I really scared of passing away
If it's today I hope I hear a
Cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the holy ghost till it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline
Rake in the scent of a reaper, ensuring that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon
And if I'm doomed, may the wound
Help my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot
And every day the glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about
Cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the scheme of, wondering when I'mma rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
In a direction to speak of something that's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't trying to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like "it need to be told"
Cursing the life of 20 generations after her soul
Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continued rappin
Or steady being distracted by money drugs and four
Fives, I count lives all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fighting for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Now am I worth it?
Did I put enough work in?
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off
And its my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
(Dying of Thirst)
Tired of running
Tired of hunting
My own kind
But retiring nothing
Tires are steady screeching, the driver is rubbing
Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dope on the corner
Look at the coroner
Daughter is dead
Mother is mourning her
Strayed bullets
AK bullets
Resuscitation was waiting patiently but they couldn't
Bring her back
Who got the footage?
Channel 9
Cameras is looking
It's hard to channel your energy when you know you're crooked
Banana clip, split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
How many sins?
I'm running out
How many sins?
I lost count
Dreams of ballin' like Spalding
But only shotty bounce
The reefer calling
I'm cottonmouth
Money is power, yours is ours
Lay with a snitch, die with a coward
Hope we get rich, hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song
A black flower
I'll show you how to
Dye your thirst
Dye your thirst
Dye your thirst
What are we doing?
Who are we fooling?
Hell is hot, fire is proven
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live right just by how to shoot it
Tired of running, s is humming
Tell us to visit, we lying about coming
Now back to business, loading the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is viewed
And the beef is bubbling
It's no discussion, hereditary
All of my cousins
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Too many sins
I'm running out
Somebody send
Me a well for the drought
See, all I know, is taking notes
On taking this life for granted
Granted, if he provoke
My best days, I stress days
(Lord forgive me for all my sins for I not know...)
My best days, I stress days
Say "Fuck the world," my sex slave
Money, pussy and greed; what's my next crave
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
Tired of running, tired of running
Tired of tumbling, tired of running
Tired of tumbling
Back once my momma say
"See a pastor, give me a promise
What if today was the rapture, and you completely tarnished
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dying of thirst
You dying of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works"
(Fuck... I'm tired of this shit.)
(I'm tired of fucking running... Tired of this shit... my brother, homie!)
(Is that what I think that is?!)
(I know that's not what I think that is...)
(Why are you so angry?...)
(See, you young men are dying of thirst. Do you know what that means?)
(That means that you need WATER... HOLY water.)
(You need to baptized with the Spirit of the Lord.)
(Do you want to receive God as your personal savior?)
(Ok... Repeat after me)
(Lord, God, I come to you, a sinner)
(And I humbly repent for my sins.)
(I believe that Jesus is Lord.)
(I believe You raised him from the dead.)
(I would ask that Jesus come into my life)
(And be my Lord, and Savior.)
(I receive Jesus to take control of my life)
(And that I might live for Him from this day forward.)
(Thank you Lord Jesus, for saving me with Your Precious Blood)
(In Jesus' name... Amen)
(Alright now... remember this day.)
[Hook]
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say
When I feel, and I... 
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air
I'm proud to say yea
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really really real *(x4)
[Verse 1] 
I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie even if they tell
Sweet lullabies that come with a smell
Of a dozen roses flippin' down *a green hill
You living in a world that come with plan B
Cause plan A never relay a guarantee
And plan C never could say just what it was
And your plans only can pan around love
You love him, you love them, you love her 
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love red-bottom and gold they say queen
You love hand-bag on the waist of your jean 
You love french tip and trip that pay for 
You love bank slip that tell you we paid more
You love a good hand whenever the card dealt 
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie even if they fell
Out the sky and your optics? turn stale
Where they *mold that's green
I can see you fit the bell
Of living in a world that come with Plan B
Cause Plan A only can make another mistake 
And you can't see success coming from plan C
When it all breaks you, you still say you love me
And love them and love when you love her 
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love fast cars and their present is old
You love fast women
You love keepin' control
Of everything *that you love, you love beef
You love streets, you love runnin', duckin' police
You love your hood, might even love it to death
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
The reason why I know you very well
Cause we have the same eyes can't you tell
The days I tried to cover up and conceal
My pride, it only made it harder for me to deal
When living in a that come with plan B
A scapegoat cause plan A don't come for free
And plan C just an excuse like because
Or the word "but", but what if I got love
I love them, I love when I love her
I love so much, I love when love hurts
I love first verse cause you're the girl I attract
I love second verse cause your the homie they packed
Burning like a stove top, they love cooking from scratch
I love what the both of you have to offer
In fact, I love it so much
I don't love anything else
But what love got to do with it when I don't love myself
To the point I should hate everything I do love
Should I hate living my life inside the club
Should I hate her for watching me for that reason
Should I hate him for telling me that I'm season
Should I hate them for telling me ball out
Should I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about
Hatin' all money, power, respect in my will
I'm hatin' the fact that none of that shit make me real
[Verse 1: Kendrick]
Now everybody serenade the new faith of Kendrick Lamar
This is king Kendrick Lamar
King Kendrick and I meant it, my point intended is raw
Fix your lenses forensics would've told you Kendrick had killed it
Pretend it's a massacre and the masses upon us
And I mastered being the master and dodging your honor
And the chapter that read at 25 I would live dormant like 5 in the morning
Then ring your spot while Kendrick's performing
And if they take everything, know I got
[Hook]
Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine
(Ay, Dre what's happenin' wit' it my nigga!)
[Verse 2: Dre]
Still I'm mad, peel the plastic off it, you can feel the magic
Still I'm laughing at the critics talking, I can see 'em gagging
When I'm back in the back of my city, back in the back
With a batch of them bangin' Dre Beats with me, look where I'm at
It's the murder cap' and I'm captain at birth of this gangsta rap
It's a wrap when I'm done and I come a long way from a hundred dollars a month
To a hundred mil' in a day, bitch I'm from
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Kendrick]
So come and visit the tire screeching, ambulance, policeman
Won't you spend a weekend on Rosecrans nigga
Khaki creasing, crime increasing on Rosecrans nigga
Kendrick Conan nigga
Where you sword at, hand on the cross and swore that
I do it big as Rasputia for them shooters Kama Sutra scream fuck your position and make you hold that
I'm trying to stay grounded like four flats
But I know flats and Piru Crip tats
Will swarm on me like a beehive
Hop in the G ride
From the West to the East side
Know that's just how Compton roll
[Verse 4: Dre (and Kendrick)]
And that's a given
I pass the blunt then pass the torch of course that's my decision
I crash the Porsche then you report that you see me in Benzes
I must report that we import the narcotics you bought it
(Then talked about it when crack hit the speakers, the music business
I blow up every time we throw up a record
Depending on what you expecting, I'm sure it's bigger than your religion
Perfected by niggas that manifested music to live in)
[Hook]
[Verse 5: Dre]
So tell that gangster throw his set high
Roll it up in a blunt, I'mma take you on the next high
I did exactly what I wanted that's what made them checks fly
In my direction, you never questioned when I said I
Would be a mogul before I visit 2Pac and Left-eye
Eazy and Aaliyah when I see you we gon' test drive
A Lambo in heaven but for now I'm on the redeye
Flying back to my city cuz I'll forever standby
[Hook]
[Verse 6: Kendrick]
Now we can all celebrate
We can all harvest the rap artists of NWA
America target our rap market, it's controversy and hate
Harsh realities we in made our music translate
To the coke dealers, the hood rich, and the broke niggas that play
With them gorillas that know killers that know where you stay
Roll that kush, crack that case, ten bottles of rozay
This was brought to you by Dre
Now every motherfucker in here say:
"Look who's responsible for taking Compton international
I make 'em holla"
[Outro]
Ain't no city quite like mine, yeah
In the city of Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine
[Intro: Emeli Sandé & Kendrick Lamar]
You don't know what pain is, you just fuck with famous
I don't know you, I can't tell your energy is dangerous
I don't know how long it took to finally come alive
So bitch don't kill my vibe
Yeah, I can feel the changes, and I can tell you hating
Save your breath I'm sick to death of fake congratulations
You don't know how much I had to give to come alive
So bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes, I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you to me is painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture when the color blind is hanging with you
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake living deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge
[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me then put me on stages
To me that's amazing
To you that's a quick check with all disrespect let me say this
[Hook: Kendrick Lamar & Emeli Sandé]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
You're trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I'm looking right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
To die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know this is something you can blame
On yourselves you can remain stuck in a box
I'm a break out and then hide every lock
I'm a break out and then hide every lock
[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
[Hook: Kendrick Lamar & Emeli Sandé]
[Outro: Kendrick Lamar & Emeli Sandé]
You ain't heard a chorus like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air I can see you are, in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings now what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfucking much, I got my drink I got my music
I say bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Lord God
I come to you a sinner
And I humbly repent for my sins
I believe that Jesus is Lord
I believe that you raised him from the dead
I will ask that Jesus will come to my life
And be my Lord and Savior
I receive Jesus to take control of my life
And that I may live for him from this day forth
Thank you Lord Jesus for saving me with your precious blood
In Jesus' name, Amen
I met her at this house party on El Segundo and Central
She had the credentials of strippers in Atlanta
Ass came with a hump from the jump she was a camel
I want to ride like Arabians, push an '04 Mercedes-Benz
"Hello my name is Kendrick," she said "No, you're handsome"
Whispered in my ear, disappeared then found her dancing
Ciara had played in the background
The parade music we made had us all wearing shades now (Cool)
"Where you stay?" She said "Down the street from Dominguez High"
Okay, I know that's borderline Compton or Paramount
"Well is it Compton?"
"No," she replied and quickly start batting her eyes and
Strictly had wanted her thighs around me
Seventeen, with nothing but pussy stuck on my mental
My motive was rather sinful
"What you trying to get into?"
She didn't tell, just gave me her Nextel
Dropped the number, we chirped the whole summer and well
The summer had passed and now I'm liking her
Conversation we having probably enticing her
Who could imagine, maybe my actions would end up wifing her
Love or lust, regardless we'll fuck cause the trife in us
It's deep rooted, the music of being young and dumb
Its never muted, in fact it's much louder where I'm from
We know a lot 'bout each other, her mother was a crack addict
She live with her granny and her younger two brothers
Her favorite cousin Demetrius's irrepetible
Family history of gang banging - did make me skeptical
But not enough to stop me from getting a nut
I wanna come over, what's up? That's what I told her soon as this episode
Of Martin go off, I'm trying to get off
I was in heat like a cactus, my tactics of being thirsty
Probably could hurt me, but fuck it I got some heart
Grab my momma's keys, hopped in the car, then oh boy
So now I'm down Rosecrans in a Caravan
Passing Alameda, my gas meter in need of a pump
I got enough to get me through the traffic jam
At least I hope cause my pockets broke as a promise man
I'm thinking bout that sex, thinking bout her thighs
Or maybe kissing on her neck, or maybe what positions next
Sent a picture of her titties blowing up my texts
I looked at 'em and almost ran my front bumper into Corvette
Enthused by the touch of a woman, she's a masseuse
And I'm a professional porn star when off the Goose
I had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransom
I'm hoping to get her loose like an Uncle Luke Anthem
I'm two blocks away, 250 feet
And six steps from where she stay, she waving me 'cross the street
I pulled up a smile on my face, and then I see
Two niggas, two black hoodies, I froze as my phone rang
Please leave your message for 323-
Record your message after the tone
Kendrick. Where you at? Head home! I'm sittin' here waitin' on my van
You told me you was gon' be back in fiffteen minutes!

Don't you see that long line
And they waiting on Kendrick like the 1st and the 15th
3's in the air I can see you are - in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings now what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My new year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfucking much, I got my drink I got my music
I say, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Martin had a dream
Martin had a dream
Kendrick have a dream
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for 72 hours
God damn I feel amazing, damn I'm in the matrix
My mind is living on cloud 9 and this 9 is never on vacation
Start up that Maserati and VROOM VROOM!
I'm racing
Poppin pills in the lobby and I pray they don't find her naked
And I pray you niggas is hating, shooters go after Judas
Jesus Christ if I live life on my knees, ain't no need to do this
Park it in front of Lueders, next to that Church's Chicken
All you pussies is losers, all my niggas is winners, screaming
Goddamn I got bitches
(okay!) damn I got bitches (okay!)
Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I've got 25 lighters on my dresser, yes sir
Put fire to that ass body cast on a stretcher
And her body got that ass that a ruler couldn't measure
And it make me cum fast but I never get embarrassed
And I recognize you have what I've been wanting since that record
That Adina Howard had pop it fast to impress her
She rollin' I'm holding my scrotum imposing
This voice here is golden so fuck y'all I goes in and
Damn I got bitches, damn I got
bitches
Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or nigga... It's go time!!!
I roll in dough with a good grind
And I run at ho with a baton
That's a relay race with a bouquet
They say, "
K, you gon' marry mines?"
Beeitch!!! (no way) Beeitch!!! (no way)
Beeitch!!! (no way) Beeitch!!! (okay)
I'm never living life confined
It's a failure even if I'm blind
I can tell ya who, what, when, where how
To sell ya game right on time
Beeitch!!! (go play) Beeitch!!! (go play)
Beeitch!!! (go play) Beeitch!!!
I look like OJ
Killing everything from pussy to a mothafuckin' Hit-Boy beat
She pussy poppin' and I got options like an audible, I be
C-O-M-P-T-O-N I win then ball at your defeat
C-O-M-P-T-O-N my city mobbin' in the street, yellin'
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for 72 hours
Goddamn I got bitches
Damn I got bitches
Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
Let it run Ali
Martin had a dream
Martin had a dream
Kendrick have a dream
Everybody, everybody
Everybody
Everybody sit your bitch ass down and listen to this true mothafuckin' story told by Kendrick Lamar on Rosecrans, ya bitch
Smoking on the finest dope
Aye aye aye aye
Drank until I can't no mo'
Aye aye aye aye
Really I'm a sober soul
But I'm with the homies right now
And we ain't asking for no favors
Rush a nigga quick then laugh about it later
Aye aye aye aye
Really I'm a peacemaker
But I'm with the homies right now
And momma used to say
One day, it's gon' burn you out
One day, it's gon' burn you out, out
One day, it's gon' burn you out
One day, it's gon' burn you
I'm with the homies right now
Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota
A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, and orange soda
Janky stash box when the federales roll up
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor
We on the mission for bad bitches and trouble
I hope the universe love you today
‘Cause the energy we bringing sure to carry away
A flock of positive activists and fill the body with hate
If it's necessary
Bumping Jeezy first album looking distracted
Speaking language only we know, you think it's an accent
The windows roll down all I see is a hand pass it
Hotboxing like George Foreman grilling the masses
Of the working world, we pulled up on a bunch of working girls
And asked them what they working with – look at me
I got the blunt in my mouth
Usually I'm drug-free, but shit I'm with the homies
(Yea nigga, we off a pill and Remy Red
Come through and bust ya head nigga)
Me and the homies
(Sag all the way to the liquor store
Where my niggas pour up 4 and get twisted some more)
Me and the homies
(I ride for my mothafuckin' niggas
Hop out, do my stuff, then hop back in)
Me and the homies
(Matter fact, I hop out that mothafucka and be like
"Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo!...Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo!")
It's 2: 30 and the sun is beaming
Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screaming
Hungry for anything unhealthy and if nutrition can help me
I'll tell you to suck my dick then I'll continue eating
We speeding on the 405 passing Westchester
You know the light skin girls in all the little dresses, good Lord
They knew we weren't from ‘round there
‘Cause every time we down there we pulling out the Boost Mobile sim cards
Bougie bitches with no extensions
Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination
Before we sparked a conversation
We seen three niggas in colors we didn't like then started interrogating
I never was a gangbanger, I mean I was never stranger to the folk neither
I really doubt it
Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it
That's ironic ‘cause I've never been violent, until I'm with the homies
(Just ridin', just ridin')
Me and the homies
(Bullshittin', actin' a fool)
Me and the homies
(Trippin', really trippin')
Me and the homies
(Just ridin', just ridin', just ridin'…)
Bragging ‘bout the episode we just had
A shot of Hennessey didn't make me feel that bad
I'm usually a true firm believer of bad karma
Consequences from evil will make your past haunt you
We tryna conquer the city with disobedience
Quick to turn it up, even if we ain't got the CD in
But Jeezy still playing and our attitude is still "nigga, what is you saying"
Pull in front of the house that we been camping out for like two months
The sun is going down as we take whatever we want
(Ay, ay, nigga cash out, pop the safe
Ay nigga, I think it's somebody in this room
Wait, what?
Nigga, it's somebody in this room!)
I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo
DVDs, plasma screen TVs in the trunk
We made a right, then made a left made a right
Then made a left, we was just circling life
My mama called – "Hello? What you doin'? "Kicking it"
I should've told her I'm probably ‘bout to catch my first offense with the homies
But they made a right, they made a left then made a right
Then another right
One lucky night with the homies
K. Dot, you faded, hood?
Yea we finally got that nigga faded. I think he hit the wrong blunt though
Ooh, which one?
Well which one he talking 'bout? I was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it
I prayed he hit that
Nah, that nigga straight. He ain't hit that one
Got the shenanigans? Give that nigga the shenanigans
Nigga I think we should push back to the city, fo real doe
Nigga, for what?
What that nigga, what's that Jeezy song say nigga?
"Last time I checked I was the man on these streets!"
Yea, yea, that shit right there. I'm tryna be the nigga in the street
There he go. Man you don't even know how the shit go
Look, here's the plan??. We gon' use the kickback as a alibi
Wait 'til the sun go down, roll out, complete the mission, drop K. Dot off at his mama van, at the park, cause I know he tryna fuck on Sherane tonight
Then we all gon' meet back at the block at about 10: 30
That's straight but we should meet up around 12; I'm tryna fuck on something too
Nigga sit yo dumb ass back down, nigga you ain't doing shit tonight
Matter fact, nigga get in the mothafuckin' car. We finna get active
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Me and my niggas tryna get it you bitch
Hit this house lick tell me is you with it you bitch
Home invasion was persuasive
From nine to five I know its vacant you bitch
Dreams of living life like rappers do
Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool
I fucked Sherene then went to tell my bros
Then Usher Raymond "Let it Burn" came on
Hot sauce in my Top Ramen, ya bitch
Parked the car and then we started rhyming, ya bitch
The only thing we had to free our mind
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs
You looking like an easy come up you bitch
A silver spoon I know you come from you bitch
And that's a lifestyle that we never knew
Go at a reverend for the revenue
[Hook]
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison tell me what you doEverybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
And I been hustlin' all day, this a way, that a way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel
A dollar might, just fuck your main bitch that's just how I feel
A dollar might, say fuck them niggas that you came with that's just how I feel
A dollar might, just make that lane switch that's just how I feel
A dollar might, turn to a million and we all rich that's just how I feel
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Dreams of living life like rappers do
Bump that new E-40 after school
You know big ballin with my homies
Earl Stevens had us thinking rational
Back to reality we pour
Another casualty of war
Two bullets in my uncle tony head
He said one day I'd be on tour
That Louie's Burger never be the same
A louis belt will never ease that pain
But I'mma purchase when that day is jerkin'
Pull off at Church's with Pirelli's skirtin'
Gang signs out the window
Hoping all of em offend you
They say your hood is a pot of gold
And we gone crash it when nobodies home
[Hook]
[Unknown Girl Sings]
Be the last one out to get this dough? , No Way
Love one of you bucket headed hoes?, No Way
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No Way
Hit the brakes, when they on patrol..No Way. [2x]
[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
Imagine Rock up in the projects
Where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings
Liquor spilling pistols popping
Baking soda YOLA whipping
Ain't no turkey on Thanksgiving
My homeboy just domed a nigga
I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue
Everyday I'm hustling
What else is a thug to do?
When you eatin' cheese from the government
Gotta provide for my daughter 'n'em
Get the fuck up out my way, bitch
Got that drum and got them bass
Just like a parade, bitch
Drop that work up in the bush
And just hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do tell the truth
This the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut
Them serpents lurking blood
Bitches selling pussy, niggas selling drugs
But it's all good
Broken promise sister you're watching tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a footlocker is
In the streets with a heater under my dungarees
Dreams of me getting shaded under a money tree
[Intro]
Every second, every minute, man I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch put your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now, put me in the mood
I'm talking 'bout dark room, perfume
Go, go!
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I recognize your fragrance (hol' up!)
You ain't never gotta say shit (woo!)
And I know your taste is
A little bit (mmm) high maintenance (ooh)
Everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it ?
I mean write poems in these songs dedicated to you
And you're in the mood for empathy, theres blood in my pen
Better yet when your friends and them
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and
Y'all curled in that little bitty range I heard that
She wanna go and party, She wanna go and party
Nigga don't approach her with that Atari
Nigga that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation, rule a nation, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs
'less I write it down for real, P.S
[Hook x2: Kendrick Lamar]
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just know just know just know just know just
What you want, Poetic Justice, put it in a song
[Verse 2: Drake]
I really hope you play this
Cause ol' girl you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs and all these one off vacations
You've been taken
Clearly a lot for me to take in
It don't make sense
Young East African Girl, you too busy fucking with your other man
I was trying to put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your mama to the motherland
I could do it, maybe one day
When you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's all right here in the city
And you don't run from where we come from
That sound like Poetic Justice, Poetic Justice
You were so new to this life but God damn you got adjusted
I mean I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin, and your big ass in that sundress (ooh!)
Good God, what you doing that walk for?
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
And they say communication saves relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write them down for real
P.S...
[Hook]
[Verse 3 : Kendrick Lamar]
Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Making sure my punctuation curve
Every letter is true
Living my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talking poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it ?
I mean you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb, It's you looking in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, It's you looking poor maybe
Call me crazy, We can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common
And what we have common is pain
I mean you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb and I can see power steering
Sex drive when you swerve, I want that interference
It's coherent, I can hear it, mmhmm
That's your heartbeat
It either caught me or it called me, mmhmm
Breathe slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly
And right before you go blind
P.S.....
[Hook]
[Skit]
"I'm gon' ask you one more time homie, where is you from? Or it is a problem"
"Ay you over here for Sherane homie?"
"Yo I don't care who this nigga over here for, if he don't tell where he come, it's a wrap! I'm sorry"
"Hol' up hol' up hol' up, we gon' do it like this, OK? I'mma tell you where I'm from, you gon' tell me where you from, OK? Or where your Grandma stay, where your mama stay, or where your daddy stay, OK?"
"Enough with all this talkin"
"Matter of fact, get out the van homie. Get out the car before I snatch you out that mother fucker homie"
Mass hallucination baby
Ill education baby
Want to reconnect with your elations
This is your station baby
Look inside these walls and you see them having withdrawals
Of a prisoner on his way
Trapped inside your desire
To fire bullets that stray
Track a tire just tell you I'm tired and ran away
I should ask a choir what do you require
To sing a song that acquire me to have faith
As the record spin I should pray
For the record I recognize that I'm easily prey
I got ate alive yesterday
I got animosity building
It's probably big as a building
Me jumping off of the roof
Is me just playing it safe
But what am I supposed to do
When the topic is red or blue
And you understand that I ain't
But know I'm accustomed to
Just a couple that look for trouble
And live in the street with rank
No better picture to paint than me walking from bible study
And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face
From a function that tooken place
They was wondering if I bang
Step on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks
I don't mind because one day you respect
The good kid, m.A.A.d. city
Mass hallucination baby
Ill education baby
Want to reconnect with your elations
This is your station baby
All I see is strobe lights
Blinding me in my hindsight
Finding me by myself
Promise me you can help
In all honesty I got time to be copacetic
Until you have finally made a decision to hold me against my will
It was like a head on collision that folded me standing still
I can never pick out the difference
And grade a cop on the bill
Every time you clock in the morning
I feel you just want to kill
All my innocence while ignoring my purpose
To persevere as a better person
I know you heard this and probably in fear
But what am I supposed to do
With the blinking of red and blue
Flash from the top of your roof
And your dog has to say woof
And you ask "lift up your shirt"
Cause you wonder if a tattoo
Of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
Gang files, but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile
I heard them chatter: "He's probably young but I know that he's down"
Step on his neck as hard as your bullet proof vest
He don't mind, he know we never respect
The good kid, m.A.A.d. city
Mass hallucination baby
Ill education baby
Want to reconnect with your elations
This is your station baby
All I see in this room
20 Xanies and these 'shrooms
Grown-up candy for pain
Can we live in the same society
It's entirely stressful upon my brain
You hired me as a victim
I quietly hope for change
When violence is the rhythm
Inspired me to obtain
The silence in this room
With 20 Xanies and 'shrooms
Some grown-up candy I lost it
I feel it's nothing to lose
The streets sure to release the worst side of my best
Don't mind, cause now you ever in debt
To good kid, m.A.A.d. city
Mass hallucination baby
Ill education baby
Want to reconnect with your elations
This is your station baby
[Intro/Bridge]If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street I hear
[ScHoolBoy Q]
"YACK! YACK! YACK! YACK!"
[Hook]
"Man down
Where you from, nigga?"
"Fuck who you know, where you from my nigga?"
"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"
This m.A.A.d city like, "Run, my nigga."
[Verse 1]
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin crack or move cocaine
This is cul de sac and plenty congnac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin on your brain
It was Me, O-Boog[?], and Yaya[?] watchin Lucky ride down Rosecrantz
It got ugly, wavin yo hand out the window. Check yo self
Uh, warriors and Conans
Hope euphoria can slow dance with society
The driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand, where --- hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder saying that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin at him different
That was back when I was nine
Joey packed the nine
Packed to stand on every porch was fine
We adapt to crime, pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin for if you ain't walkin up?
You fuckin punk, pickin up the fuckin pump
Pickin off you suckers, suck a dick or die or sucker punch
Or warn the bullets comin from
AK's,AR's,"aye y'all. Duck."
That's what momma said when we was eatin the free lunch
Aw man, God damn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94. Fuck yo truce
Now crawl yo head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just pieces
BG's up to pre-approve, bodies on top of bodies
IV's on top of IV's
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trollie
Make sure your colors correct
Make sure you're cornbread, or they'll be callin your mother collect
They say the governor collect, all of our taxes except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin backwards if you suggest that you sleep wit a Teck
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess
M.A.A.d city
[Hook]
"Man down
Where you from, nigga?"
"Fuck who you know, where you from my nigga?"
"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"
This m.A.A.d city like, "Run, my nigga."
[Intro/Bridge]
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street I hear
[ScHoolBoy Q]
"YACK! YACK! YACK!---
(static)
[MC Eiht]
Wake yo punk ass up!
It ain't nothin but a Compton thang
Chyea
Real simple and plain
I'mma teach you some lessons about the street
It ain't nothin but a Compton thang
Chyea
How we do
[Verse 2]
Fresh outta school cause I was a high school grad
Sleeping in the living room in my momma's pad
Reality struck I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole two nigga's hopped out on foot and dahsed
My Pops said I needed a job I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leaving
In fact I got fired because I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I really don't smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foaming at the mouth
I was straight tweaking the next weekend we broke even
I made a legion then made a promise to see you bleeding
You know the reasons but still won't ever know my life
Kendrick AKA Compton's human sacrifice
[Mc Eight]
Cocaine, weed
Nigga's been mixing shit since the 80's loc
Shine sticks, buck nakeds
Make a nigga flip
Coke heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alandra, Rosecrants, Bullice
I'm still in the hood
Loc yeah that's cool
The hood took me under so I follow the rules
But yeah that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doing the same thing
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately
Couple of IV's with the fucking spraycan
Shots in the crowd then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, harsh turn brave
Mount up regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip
Trip, we in the hood still
So loc, grab a strap cause yeah, it's so real
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and 10 grand's where motherfuckers stand
[Kendrick Lamar]
If I told you I killed a nigga at 16, would you believe me?
Or see me to be innocent Kendrick that you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now & Laters to eat
If I'm mashing all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of being a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the corners like hostage
Kill them all if they gossip, the Children of the Corn
They realizing the option of living a lie, drive they body with toxins
Constantly drinking and drive, hit the power then watch this flame
That arrive in his eye; this a coward, the concept is aim and
They bang it and slide out that bitch with the pies
And the price on his head, the tots probably go to the projects
I live inside the belly of the rough
Compton, U.S.A. made Me an Angel on Angel Dust, what
Pour up, dank, head shot, dank
Sit down, dank, stand up, dank
Pass out, dank, wake up, dank
Faded, dank, faded, dank
Now I done grew up 'round some people living their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask, back stroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels, some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in the dark room, loud tunes, looking to make a vow soon
That I'mma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup, I see the crowd mood
Changing by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me:
Nigga why you babysittin only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it
Pour up, dank, head shot, dank
Sit down, dank, stand up, dank
Pass out, dank, wake up, dank
Faded, dank, faded, dank
Okay, now open your mind up and listen to me, Kendrick
I'm your conscience, if you do not hear me, then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now and I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down I'mma drown in some poison abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes
I see the feelin', the freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrive
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice
Then apparently, I'm over influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most then someone said to me
Nigga why you babysittin only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it
Pour up, dank, head shot, dank
Sit down, dank, stand up, dank
Pass out, dank, wake up, dank
Faded, dank, faded, dank
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out. Do you; bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you, bang
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
Nigga why you babysittin only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it
Pour up, dank, head shot, dank
Sit down, dank, stand up, dank
Pass out, dank, wake up, dank
Faded, dank, faded, dank
Aw man, what is she taking?
Where is she taking
All I, all I, all I, all I, all I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got Hunger pain that grow insane, tell me do that sound familiar?
If it do then you're like me, making excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release everything that corrode inside of me
I see you joking, why you laugh? don't you feel bad?
I probably sleep and never ever wake up
Never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust
But just when I thought I had enough
When the lights shut off
And its my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off
And its my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow
I'm hoping that I can borrow a piece of mind
I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright
And a fight he tried to put up, but the type
Of bullet that stuck had went against his will
As blood spilled on your hands
My plans rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back whispering, "Get em"
I got em, and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality that told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover
A passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a young'n
In pajamas and Dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs
Dumb niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child
I'm proud and well devoted
This piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'mma push it, wherever whenever
And I love you cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop I hope
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off
And its my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it "Section .80," the message resemble "Brenda's Got a Baby"
Whats crazy was, I was hearin about it
But doubted your ignorance, how could you ever
Just put her on blast and shit
Judging her past and shit
Well it's completely my future
A nigga behind me right now asking for ass and shit
And I'mma need that 40 dollars even if I gotta
Fuck, suck and swallow in the parking lot
Gonzales Park, I'm followed by a married man, a father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tingling keys
Matter of fact he my favorite cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get em back
To where they used to be then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman, or better yet a leader
You need her to learn something, then you probably need to beat her
That's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted
But fuck that "Sorry for your loss" shit
My sister died in vain, but what point are you trying to gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait
Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
Cause I don't need the attention bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away
I know my fate, and I'm on the grind for this cake
I'mma get or die trying, I'm eyeing every male gender with intentions of buying
You lying to these motherfuckers, talking about you can help with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me nigga, fuck your glory nigga, this bullshit...
When the lights shut off
And its my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off
And its my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
Sometimes I look in a mirror and ask myself
Am I really scared of passing away
If it's today I hope I hear a
Cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the holy ghost till it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline
Rake in the scent of a reaper, ensuring that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon
And if I'm doomed, may the wound
Help my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot
And every day the glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about
Cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the scheme of, wondering when I'mma rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
In a direction to speak of something that's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't trying to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like "it need to be told"
Cursing the life of 20 generations after her soul
Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continued rappin
Or steady being distracted by money drugs and four
Fives, I count lives all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fighting for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Now am I worth it?
Did I put enough work in?
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off
And its my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
(Dying of Thirst)
Tired of running
Tired of hunting
My own kind
But retiring nothing
Tires are steady screeching, the driver is rubbing
Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dope on the corner
Look at the coroner
Daughter is dead
Mother is mourning her
Strayed bullets
AK bullets
Resuscitation was waiting patiently but they couldn't
Bring her back
Who got the footage?
Channel 9
Cameras is looking
It's hard to channel your energy when you know you're crooked
Banana clip, split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
How many sins?
I'm running out
How many sins?
I lost count
Dreams of ballin' like Spalding
But only shotty bounce
The reefer calling
I'm cottonmouth
Money is power, yours is ours
Lay with a snitch, die with a coward
Hope we get rich, hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song
A black flower
I'll show you how to
Dye your thirst
Dye your thirst
Dye your thirst
What are we doing?
Who are we fooling?
Hell is hot, fire is proven
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live right just by how to shoot it
Tired of running, s is humming
Tell us to visit, we lying about coming
Now back to business, loading the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is viewed
And the beef is bubbling
It's no discussion, hereditary
All of my cousins
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Too many sins
I'm running out
Somebody send
Me a well for the drought
See, all I know, is taking notes
On taking this life for granted
Granted, if he provoke
My best days, I stress days
(Lord forgive me for all my sins for I not know...)
My best days, I stress days
Say "Fuck the world," my sex slave
Money, pussy and greed; what's my next crave
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
Tired of running, tired of running
Tired of tumbling, tired of running
Tired of tumbling
Back once my momma say
"See a pastor, give me a promise
What if today was the rapture, and you completely tarnished
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dying of thirst
You dying of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works"
(Fuck... I'm tired of this shit.)
(I'm tired of fucking running... Tired of this shit... my brother, homie!)
(Is that what I think that is?!)
(I know that's not what I think that is...)
(Why are you so angry?...)
(See, you young men are dying of thirst. Do you know what that means?)
(That means that you need WATER... HOLY water.)
(You need to baptized with the Spirit of the Lord.)
(Do you want to receive God as your personal savior?)
(Ok... Repeat after me)
(Lord, God, I come to you, a sinner)
(And I humbly repent for my sins.)
(I believe that Jesus is Lord.)
(I believe You raised him from the dead.)
(I would ask that Jesus come into my life)
(And be my Lord, and Savior.)
(I receive Jesus to take control of my life)
(And that I might live for Him from this day forward.)
(Thank you Lord Jesus, for saving me with Your Precious Blood)
(In Jesus' name... Amen)
(Alright now... remember this day.)
[Hook]
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say
When I feel, and I... 
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air
I'm proud to say yea
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really really real *(x4)
[Verse 1] 
I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie even if they tell
Sweet lullabies that come with a smell
Of a dozen roses flippin' down *a green hill
You living in a world that come with plan B
Cause plan A never relay a guarantee
And plan C never could say just what it was
And your plans only can pan around love
You love him, you love them, you love her 
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love red-bottom and gold they say queen
You love hand-bag on the waist of your jean 
You love french tip and trip that pay for 
You love bank slip that tell you we paid more
You love a good hand whenever the card dealt 
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie even if they fell
Out the sky and your optics? turn stale
Where they *mold that's green
I can see you fit the bell
Of living in a world that come with Plan B
Cause Plan A only can make another mistake 
And you can't see success coming from plan C
When it all breaks you, you still say you love me
And love them and love when you love her 
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love fast cars and their present is old
You love fast women
You love keepin' control
Of everything *that you love, you love beef
You love streets, you love runnin', duckin' police
You love your hood, might even love it to death
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
The reason why I know you very well
Cause we have the same eyes can't you tell
The days I tried to cover up and conceal
My pride, it only made it harder for me to deal
When living in a that come with plan B
A scapegoat cause plan A don't come for free
And plan C just an excuse like because
Or the word "but", but what if I got love
I love them, I love when I love her
I love so much, I love when love hurts
I love first verse cause you're the girl I attract
I love second verse cause your the homie they packed
Burning like a stove top, they love cooking from scratch
I love what the both of you have to offer
In fact, I love it so much
I don't love anything else
But what love got to do with it when I don't love myself
To the point I should hate everything I do love
Should I hate living my life inside the club
Should I hate her for watching me for that reason
Should I hate him for telling me that I'm season
Should I hate them for telling me ball out
Should I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about
Hatin' all money, power, respect in my will
I'm hatin' the fact that none of that shit make me real
[Verse 1: Kendrick]
Now everybody serenade the new faith of Kendrick Lamar
This is king Kendrick Lamar
King Kendrick and I meant it, my point intended is raw
Fix your lenses forensics would've told you Kendrick had killed it
Pretend it's a massacre and the masses upon us
And I mastered being the master and dodging your honor
And the chapter that read at 25 I would live dormant like 5 in the morning
Then ring your spot while Kendrick's performing
And if they take everything, know I got
[Hook]
Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine
(Ay, Dre what's happenin' wit' it my nigga!)
[Verse 2: Dre]
Still I'm mad, peel the plastic off it, you can feel the magic
Still I'm laughing at the critics talking, I can see 'em gagging
When I'm back in the back of my city, back in the back
With a batch of them bangin' Dre Beats with me, look where I'm at
It's the murder cap' and I'm captain at birth of this gangsta rap
It's a wrap when I'm done and I come a long way from a hundred dollars a month
To a hundred mil' in a day, bitch I'm from
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Kendrick]
So come and visit the tire screeching, ambulance, policeman
Won't you spend a weekend on Rosecrans nigga
Khaki creasing, crime increasing on Rosecrans nigga
Kendrick Conan nigga
Where you sword at, hand on the cross and swore that
I do it big as Rasputia for them shooters Kama Sutra scream fuck your position and make you hold that
I'm trying to stay grounded like four flats
But I know flats and Piru Crip tats
Will swarm on me like a beehive
Hop in the G ride
From the West to the East side
Know that's just how Compton roll
[Verse 4: Dre (and Kendrick)]
And that's a given
I pass the blunt then pass the torch of course that's my decision
I crash the Porsche then you report that you see me in Benzes
I must report that we import the narcotics you bought it
(Then talked about it when crack hit the speakers, the music business
I blow up every time we throw up a record
Depending on what you expecting, I'm sure it's bigger than your religion
Perfected by niggas that manifested music to live in)
[Hook]
[Verse 5: Dre]
So tell that gangster throw his set high
Roll it up in a blunt, I'mma take you on the next high
I did exactly what I wanted that's what made them checks fly
In my direction, you never questioned when I said I
Would be a mogul before I visit 2Pac and Left-eye
Eazy and Aaliyah when I see you we gon' test drive
A Lambo in heaven but for now I'm on the redeye
Flying back to my city cuz I'll forever standby
[Hook]
[Verse 6: Kendrick]
Now we can all celebrate
We can all harvest the rap artists of NWA
America target our rap market, it's controversy and hate
Harsh realities we in made our music translate
To the coke dealers, the hood rich, and the broke niggas that play
With them gorillas that know killers that know where you stay
Roll that kush, crack that case, ten bottles of rozay
This was brought to you by Dre
Now every motherfucker in here say:
"Look who's responsible for taking Compton international
I make 'em holla"
[Outro]
Ain't no city quite like mine, yeah
In the city of Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine
[Intro: Emeli Sandé & Kendrick Lamar]
You don't know what pain is, you just fuck with famous
I don't know you, I can't tell your energy is dangerous
I don't know how long it took to finally come alive
So bitch don't kill my vibe
Yeah, I can feel the changes, and I can tell you hating
Save your breath I'm sick to death of fake congratulations
You don't know how much I had to give to come alive
So bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes, I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you to me is painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture when the color blind is hanging with you
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake living deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge
[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me then put me on stages
To me that's amazing
To you that's a quick check with all disrespect let me say this
[Hook: Kendrick Lamar & Emeli Sandé]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
You're trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I'm looking right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
To die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know this is something you can blame
On yourselves you can remain stuck in a box
I'm a break out and then hide every lock
I'm a break out and then hide every lock
[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
[Hook: Kendrick Lamar & Emeli Sandé]
[Outro: Kendrick Lamar & Emeli Sandé]
You ain't heard a chorus like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air I can see you are, in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings now what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfucking much, I got my drink I got my music
I say bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
[Now I don't give up a fuck if you
Black, White, Asian, Hispanic, Goddammit
Yellow P, Sugar P, Fuck your ethnicity, nigga]
[Verse 1]
Fire burning inside my eyes
This the music that saved my life
Y'all be calling it hip-hop
I be calling it hypnotize
Yeah, hypnotize
Trapped my body but freed my mind
What the fuck is you fighting for?
Ain't nobody gonna win at war
My details be retail
Man, I got so much in store
Rasicism is still alive
Yellow tape and colored lines
Fuck that, nigga look at that line
It's sold out first day
Getting off work
And they wanna see Kendrick
Everybody can't drive Benz's, and I been there
So it make it my business, staying giving my
Full attention. 10-hut!
Man, I gotta get my wind up
Man, gotta get down with God
Cause I got my sins up
Matter of fact, don't mistake me
For no fucking rapper
They sit backstage and hide
Behind the fucking cameras
I mosh pit
Had a microphone and I tossed it
Had a brain, then I lost it
I'm out of my mind, so don't
You mind how much the cost is
Penny for my thoughts
Everybody, please hold up your wallets
Yeah man, I'm the mailman
Can't you tell, man?
Going postal, never freeze up
When I approach you
That's star struck and roast you, oh my..
[Verse 2]
I'm tired of y'all
Cause everybody lie to y'all
Do you believe it?
Recognize them false achievements
It's treason and I'm Tylenol
I knock out when you knock it off
Knock on the doors of opportunity
I'm too involved, I'm no activist
I'm no Einstein before calculus
I was kicking in Math
Dropping that science
Like an alchemist, and I be
Kicking that ass
Lyrically, I'm UFC, if a UFO
Had came for me
I'mma come back with the head of an alien
Don't alienate, my dreams
Get it right, get a life
I got 2
That's a metaphor for the
Big shit I do, boy
TMI, TSA, man I'm fly
Put wings on my back
That a plane or angel? Both
Like a pilot with a halo - whoa..
Gross..
I don't mean, nothing
So many things come through
Them, Him, Her, You
Hmm, Hmm, Hmm, Hmm
I'm just a messenger
Yeah I know life's a bitch
Get the best of her
Put them 3's up
They notice that we up
HiiiPower and the power and the people
And if they don't believe us
They'll die
[Now I don't give up a fuck if you
Black, White, Asian, Hispanic, Goddammit
Yellow P, Sugar P, Fuck your ethnicity, nigga]
I wrote this record while 30 thousand feet in the air
Stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair
If I can fuck her in front of all of these passengers
They’ll probably think I’m a terrorist
Eat my asparagus, then I’m asking her
Thoughts of a young nigga, fast money and freedom
A crash dummy for dollars, I know you dyin’ to meet ‘em
I’ll prob’ly die in a minute
Just bury me with 20 bitches, 20 million, and a Comptown fitted
Hol’ up (Hol’ up)
Hol’ up (Hol’ up)
Hol’ up (Hol’ up)
Hol’ up (Hol’ up)
Yeah, big shit poppin’
Section 80
Back in this bitch in the back of that bitch
With my back against the wall and your bitch on the edge of my dick
Jump-off
I call a bitch a bitch, a ho a ho, a woman a woman
I never did nothing but break the ground on top of the asphalt
Tire mark gave you evidence that
I’m easily peddling with the speed of a lightning bolt
As a kid I killed two adults, I’m too advanced
I lived my 20's at two years old, the wiser man
Truth be told, I’m like '87
Wicked as 80 reverends in a pool of fire with devils holding hands
From the distance, don’t know which one is a Christian. damn
Who can I trust in 2012? There’s no one not even myself
A Gemini screaming for help, somebody
Yeah, big shit poppin', everybody watchin'
When you do it like this, nigga, losin' ain't a option
Yeah, big shit poppin'
Ay, Ay, kick her out the studio, Ali
24/7 nigga, workin’ his ass for it, she poppin’ that ass for it
The King of Diamonds wit’ diamonds I never do ask for
They checkin’ my passport, I’m too accustomed with Customs
She call in the task force, I killed it, somebody cuff ‘em
They want me to fast-forward the game, and why you complain
When you niggas is past poor, you’ll never hop in my lane
When you pushin’ a RAV4, you wreckin’ my Jaguar
You play like a bad sport, her feet on the dashboard
Yeah, big shit poppin', everybody watchin'
When you do it like this, nigga, losin' ain't a option
Yeah, big shit poppin', everybody watchin'
When you do it like this, nigga
I wrote this record while 30 thousand feet in the air
Stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair
If I can fuck her in front of all of these passengers
They’ll probably think I’m Osama
The plane emergency landed: it was an honor
[Hook]
Fuck thought
8 doobies to the face
Fuck thought
12 bottles in the case
Nigga, fuck thought
2 pills and a half, wait
Nigga, fuck thought
Got a high tolerance
When your age don't exist
[Verse 1]
Man, I swear
My nigga trippin off that shit again
Pick him up, then I set him in
Cold water, then I order someone to bring him vicodin
In order to get away
From the feeling that he feel today
You know when you part of Section.80
And you feeling like no one can relate
Cause you are, you are
A loner, loner
Marijuana, endorphins
Make you stronger, stronger
I'm in the house party trippin off
My generation sippin cough syrup like its water
Never no pancakes in the kitchen
Man, no wonder our lives is caught up
In the daily superstition
That the word is bout to end
Who gives a fuck? we never do listen
Unless it comes with an 808
A melody and some hoes
Playstation and some drank
Technology bumping soul(?)
Looking around and all I see
Is a big crowd, that's product of me
And they probably relatives
Relevant for a ?
Yep, the president is black
She black too
Purple label on her back
But that dap, is like ?
She take it straight to the head
Then she look at me
She ADHD
[Hook]
[Bridge]
Like woah oh oh woah (x4)
(Don't got a limit just gimme some more with it)
(Don't got a limit just gimme some more with it)
(They always told me ad-hd did it)
[Verse 2]
And then she started
And then she started
Feeling herself like no on else in this apartment
Beg you pardon
Oh I rap baby, how old are you?
She say 22, I say 23
Ok then we all crack babies
Damn, why you say that?
She said where my drink at?
I’mma tell you later, just tell your neighbors
Have the police relax
I stood up, shut the blinds
Closed the screen, jumped on ?
Made it to the back, where she reside
Then she said, read between the lines
Yep, hope that I get close enough
When the lights turn down
And the fact that she just might open up
When the new ? start to drown
Her body and I, know the both of us really deep in the move now
It’s nothing we can do now
Somebody walked in with a pound
Of that Bay Area kush
She looked at me then looked
At it, then she grabbed it
Then she said, get it understood
You know why we crack babies
Because we born in the 80s
That ADHD crazy
[Hook]
[Bridge]
[Outro]
You can have all my shine i'll give u the light
Give you the light
Double cup, deuce, four, six
Just mix it in Sprite
Ecstasy, shrooms, blow, dro, hoes
Whatever you like
You can have all my shine i'll give u the light
Give you the light

Don′t judge me

I know this girl, she a real good girl and she be low-keyLooking like a star, with a real nice car, a Mercedes key
She got a nigga and she love this nigga, well, at least I think
Everytime we bark, she pay us no mind in the middle of the street
She be like

Fuck them other niggas 'cause I′m down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas, I′ll ride for my nigga
I′ll die for my nigga, fuck them other-

Until one day, he wasn't acting right
In the middle of the night, she checked his phone, Erica, right
When he plead the fifth, man, it was on, matter of fact she gone
Matter of fact Tyrone was on speed dial
So when she got home, it was going down, she go

Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Sick of lies from her nigga, fuck that other-

I know this girl, she a real hood girl, and she with the shit
Keep her hair tied up, big bamboos, Mike Jordan kicks
With that big butt, but when I try to holla, she gon′ resist
In her man she trust, so when I walk by her, she be screaming this
She be like

Fuck them other niggas 'cause I′m down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I′m down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas, I'll ride for my nigga
I'll die for my nigga, fuck them other-

Until one day he wasn′t acting right in the middle of the night
She checked his pockets, found condoms by Magnum
And the moment they was acknowledged, she popped his eye
Then ran outside, then started driving on the passenger side
Homeboy was smiling, she gon′

Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Sick of lies from her nigga, fuck that other-

And so, these girls, these vulnerable girls, took they men up
Put 'em in their world, their vulnerable world, and just like that
It was only getting they feelings hurt, tell me how that sound?
They got fed up with the biggest question mark, they curious now
′Cause when women get sick of men, they think of a big helping hand
To lend each other uncover emotions when lights dim
So when she telling her to come over, it'll be alright
The minute she hit the block and turn left, she′ll be turning dyke, they go

Fuck with other bitches when they tired of these niggas
Fuck with other bitches when they tired of these niggas
Fuck with other bitches on the side 'cause these niggas

 We make it to twenty one (one, one, one)
 Whooo-oa-oa-oh, oa-oa-oh
 I'm glad we were able to talk about her vice and her evils. There's a more important topic I'd like to discuss
 The dysfunctional bastards of the Ronald Reagan Era. Young men that learned to do everything spiteful
 This is your generation. Live fast and die young. Who's willing to explain this story?
 Riding with them boys and girls and we're high (high)
 All we want to do is have a good time (time)
 Young wild and reckless is how we live life (life)
 Pray that we make it to twenty one (one, one, one)
 Whoooaa, whooaaa
 We make it to twenty one (one, one, one)
 Whooo-oa-oa-oh, oa-oa-oh
 Riding with them boys and girls and we're high (high)
 All we want to do is have a good time (time)
 Young wild and reckless is how we live life (life)
 Pray that we make it to twenty one (one, one, one)
We're far from good
Not good from far
90 miles per hour down Compton Boulevard
With the top down, screaming we don't give a f-ck
Drink my 40 ounce of freedom while I roll my blunt
Cause the kids just aint alright
Oh shit niggas
Somethin' bout to happen
Nigga this shit, nigga this sound like 30 keys under the compton court building
Hope the dogs don't smell it
Welcome to vigilante
80â²s so don't you ask me
I'm hungry my body's antsy
I'll rip through your f-cking pantry
Peeling off like a? examine my orchestra
Granny said when I'm old enough
I'll be sure to be all I can be
You niggas Marcus Camby, washed up
Pussy fix ya panties
I'm Mr. Marcus, you gettin' f-cked, ugh
You aint heard nothing harder since Daddy Kane
Take it vain, vicodins couldn't ease the pain
Lightening bolts hit ya body, you thought it rained
Not a cloud in sight, just the shit that I write strong enough
To stand in front of a travelling freight train
Are you trained, to go against Dracula
Dragging the record industry by my fangs
AK clips, money clips and gold chains
You walk around with a P90 like it's the 90â²s
Bullet to your temple your homocide'll remind me
Them Compton crip niggas aint nothing to f-ck with
Bompton Piru's aint nothing to f-ck with
Compton esÃ©'s aint nothin' to f-ck with
But they f-ck with me and bitch I love it
Whoopty whoop, woopty woop woop
Whoopty whoop, woopty woop woopty woop woop
(California dungeons)
Whoopty whoop, woopty woop woop
Whoopty whoop, woopty woop woopty woop woop
(California dungeons)
Lets hit the county building gotta catch my check
Spend it all to a 40 ounce to the neck
And in retrospect I remember December being the hottest
Squad cars, neighbourhood wars and stolen monsters
I tell you mothaf-ckers that life is full of hydraulics
Up and down, get 64 better know how to drive it
I'm driving on E with no license or registration
Heart racin' racing past johnny because he's racist
1987, the children of Ronald Reagan raped the leaves off your front porch
With a machine blow torch
He blowing on stress, hoping to ease the stress
He copping some blow hoping that it can stretch
New born massacre, hoppin' out the passenger
With calendars cause your date coming
Run 'em down them he gun em down
I'm hoping that you fast enough
Even the legs of Michael Johnson don't mean nothin' because
Them Compton crip niggas aint nothing to f-ck with
Bompton Piru's aint nothing to f-ck with
Compton esÃ©'s aint nothin' to f-ck with
But they f-ck with me and bitch I love it
Whoopty whoop, woopty woop woop
Whoopty whoop, woopty woop woopty woop woop
(California dungeons)
Whoopty whoop, woopty woop woop
Whoopty whoop, woopty woop woopty woop woop
(California dungeons)
Can't detour when you at war with your city
Why run for?
Just ride with me, just die with me
That gun store, right there
When you fight, don't fight fair
Cause you'll never win
Can't detour when you at war with your city
Why run for?
Just ride with me, just die with me
That gun store, right there
When you fight, don't fight fair
Cause you'll never win
Yeah yeah yeah
Woah woah wo-wo-wo-woah
Woah woah wo-wo-wo-woah

In time you'll learn this is about you [x3]
 Babies from 80s don't know no better
 Don't nothing go better with ignorance
 But the belligerent kids that we living with
 Some of them masculine, some of the feminine
 'Member the universe used to be innocent
 Now they just look at us crazy like immigrants
 Everyday that I wake up, I'm a sin again
 I'm not a citizen
 I'm just a nigga from Section.80
 Show of hands, how many been taking notes?
 Good
 Leave everything on the table now
 On the real
 This is your generation
 Show, show your pain

[Verse 1]
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket
You bastard, I'm Marilyn Manson
With madness. Now just imagine the magic
I like to ask it, don't ask for
Your favorite rapper - yessir
I killed them (amen!) bitch
And this is rigamortis
And it's gorgeous when you die
Ali recorded and I'm Morpheus
The Matrix of my mind
I'm out the orbit, you an
Orphan and a hairdresser combined
I'm on the toilet when I rhyme
If you the shit then I decline
I climax where you begin and
Then I end on Cloud 9
And that's important when you morph
Into a angel in the sky
And don't be forging all my signatures
My listeners reply and tell me
That you biting style
You got a hell of an appetite
And I'mma be here for a while
Just buckle up before the ride
Or knuckle up if you could fight
We always making them duck or die
Assuming ___ is suitable and usual, it's suicide
CSI, just might investigate
This fucking parasite
That's what they telling me
Aim it at your celebrity
This is studio felony
There would not be so many
And cool enough for the 70s
Nigga, payback's a bitch
And bitch you been living in debt with me
That I more than especially
Leave a call on his mother voicemail to say that he rest in peace
Bigger chopper the recipe
Wrestling, that's irrelevant
Rather rest at your residence
Whistling to the melody
Couldn't think of a better D
Better be on your P and Q
It's just me Jay Rock, Soul and Q
So the system ain't why we ___
Ain't nothing else you can do
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket
You bastard, I'm Marilyn Manson
Don't ask who your favorite rapper
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket
You bastard, I'm Marilyn Manson
Don't ask who your favorite rapper
I rapped him and made him Casper
I captured the likes of NASA
My pedigree to fly past ya
I pass the weed to the pastor
We all are sinners, once you sinister
Bible study faster
You hypocrite is reaction of blasphemy
I assassin my casualty
And it's casually done
And tell 'em my salary come
A lump sum of hundreds, don't talk to be bout no money
The sun is under my feet
And I come in peace to compete
I don't run if you rather leap
My statistics go up in weeks
And I go visit the nearest creek
And I get busy on many MC
Really ballistic, anybody can see
Any assistance, everybody done see
Some persistence, recognize I be
Really too vicious, the permanent beast
And the demolition, breaking up the streets
Better partition, better dot your T
And I gon' mention, how the far you see
Putting my dick in the rap industry
Everybody bitchin', getting mad at me
Recognize Kendrick, in the battery
And I'm charged up, and the catastrophe
Is charged up, and audacity
And y'all fucks, never could hassle me
And y'all luck, just ran out you'll see
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket
You bastard, I'm Marilyn Manson
Don't ask for your favorite rapper

Taking off when you landing
Bitch niggas wanna throw tantrums
And I"m dancing on them stars
The galaxy ain't got room for y'all
Ain't nothing gonna happen soon for y'all
While I"m hearing, every day I hear
Your bullshit, self-pity
Reason why you never dealt with me
Reason why your girl dealt with me
Hands up, in the building we get busy
And say: RIP
That's exactly what they sound like
A to the A to the L I Y
A H, give it up 2 times
Then give it right back, don't
Blow my high
Look at my life
Then look at yours
Get some ambition, why you bored?
Time'll never wait on no man
Society will never hold your hand
Niggas like the gossip, like bitches
Got me thinking you don't like bitches
Wonder what's behind them Ray Bans
Eyes of a coward, I understand
Niggas like the gossip, like bitches
Sit down, Perignon, when we finish
We say:
RIP Aaliyah.. RIP
That's exactly what they sound like
But never will I ever forget Left Eye
Roll up, put a ribbon in the sky
And a button on your lips
Don't blow my high 
What's your life about, enlighten me
Is you gonna live on your knees, or die on your feet
Fire in the street, fire in the swisher
Fire in between the two legs of your little sister
Just get us and put us in elixir
Before they crop us out of the picture
I've never seen a crop circle
But I've seen a cop circled the block
I puff squares, but I swear one day I'm a stop my nerves itch
On the brink of my career
While my peers struggle for employment
Can you hear these screams (Uncle Sam ain't no killing me)
One two, three four grams and a fifth of Hennessey
A bad bitch, fuck the penitentiary
Such an eighties baby, blame Ronald Reagan, we raising hell
Lord forbid
The homie got wet, so we trying to soak it in
The president is black, but you can't vote for skin
You vote for the better man
Come to our show you can see the diversity
Unified people they going to peep universally
We might not change the world
But we going to manipulate it
Hope you participating
Ayo Dot, won't you let these cats know
We knew we'd be here, like back in 04'
Started hiiipower because our generation
Needed a generator and a system, meant to disintegrate us
And all we do is assist them
When kicked verbs with victims
The bigger picture hasn't developed yet
Like what if kids were celibate
What if Tammy came across a real man
Who didn't play games like child-ren
My nigga cheated on his girlfriend with his girlfriend's girlfriend
Let the world end
And everybody tripping off 2012
And the extraterrestrial presence as well (Odd Future's odd)
But our future is not, that Martial law shit dropped
We gonna all get got
So keep that question mark on your face
Eat that fast food, and use that flouride toothpaste
Hide your feelings from the public
Work a long nine to five, don't forget to pay your tithes
And to thank God you're alive (Hiiipower)
And on another note
We focused like the Hubble Telescope, Soul
Life is a traffic jam (Life is a traffic jam)
I wrote this because I resorted too
People say I speak for generation, why
Why lie, I do, Section 80
Your son will play me if the radio won't
Daughters that just turn one to twenty one listen to Kendrick
For instance
What's your life about, enlighten me
Is you gonna live on your knees, or die on your feet
Take out that student loan, and pay off your college degree
And do exactly what you see on TV
True story, hm, can you repeat that for me Soul
What's your life about, enlighten me
Is you gonna live on your knees, or die on your feet
Is you gonna plead the fifth, or sound the horn
The time is now child, come on
See a lot of ya'll don't understand Kendrick Lamar
Because you wonder how I could talk about money, hoes, clothes, god, history all in the same sentence
You know what all the things have in common
Only half of the truth, if you tell it
See I've spent twenty three years on the earth searching for answers
Til' one day I realized I had to come up with my own
I've not on the outside looking in
I'm not on the inside looking out
I'm in the death fucking center, looking around
You've ever seen a newborn baby kill a grown man
That's an analogy for the way the world make me react
My innocence been dead
So the next time I talk about money, hoes, clothes, god, history all in the same sentence
Just know I meant it, and you felt it
Because you too are searching for answers
I'm not the next pop star
I'm not the next socially aware rapper
I am a human motherfucking being, over dope ass instrumentation
Kendrick Lamar
Now fuck em' up Terrace (Soul!)
Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
Malcolm X put a hex on my future someone catch me
I'm falling victim to a revolutionary song
The Serengeti's cloned
Back to put you backstabbers back on your spinal bone
You slipped your disc when I slipped you my disc
You wanted to diss but jumped on my dick
Grown man should never bite they tongue
Unless you eating pussy that smell like it's a stale plum
I got my finger on the motherfucking pistol
Aiming it at a pig, Charlottes Web is gonna miss you
My issue wasn't televised and you ain't gotta tell the wise
How to stay on beat cause our lives an instrumental
This is physical and mental
I wouln't sugar coat it
You'll die from Diabetes if these other niggas wrote it
And everything on TV just a figment of imagination
I don't want no plastic nation
Dread that like a Hatian
While you muthafckers waiting
I be off the slave ship, building pyramids writing my own hieroglyphs
Just call this shit hiiipower
Nigga nothing less than hiiipower
5 star dishes, food for thought bitches
I mean this shit is Huey Newton going stupid
You can't resist his HiiiPower
Throw your hands up for HiiiPower
Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
If I seen it how he seen it that would make my parents happy
Sorry momma I can't turn the other cheek
They wanna knock me off the edge like a fucking widows peak, ugh
She always told me pray for the weak, ugh
Them demons got me, I ain't prayed in some weeks, ugh
Dear Lord, come and save me, the Devils working hard
He probably clocking double shifts on all of his jobs
Frightening, so fucking frightening
Enough to drive a man insane
I need a license to kill
I'm standing on a feild full of Landmines
Doing the moonwalk hoping I blow up in time
Cause 2012 might not be a fucking legend
Try and be a fucking legend
The man of mankind
Who said a black man in the illuminati?
Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party
So get up off that slave ship
Build your own pyramids, write your own hieroglyphs
Just call this shit hiiipower
Nigga nothing less than hiiipower
5 star dishes, food for thought bitches
I mean this shit is Bobby Seale making mills
You can't resist his HiiiPower
Throw your hands up for HiiiPower
Everyday we fight the system just to make our way
We've been down for too long, but that's all right
We was built to be strong, cause it's our life
Na-na-nah
Everyday we fight the system, (fight the system)
(Never liked the system)
We've been down for too long, but that's all right
Na-na-nah
Who said a black man in the illuminati?
Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party
Last time I checked we was racing with Marcus Garvey
On the freeway to Africa til I wreck my Audi
And I want everybody to view my autopsy
So you can see exactly where the government had shot me
No conspiracy my fate is inevitable
They played musical chairs, once I'm on that pedestal
Frightening, so fucking frightening
Enough to drive a man insane, a woman insane
The reason Lauren Hill don't sing or Kurt Cobain
Loaded that clip and then said BANG!
The drama it bring is crazy
Product of the late 80′s
Tryna stay above water, that's why we shun the navy
Pull your guns and play me
Let's set it off, cause a riot, thow off molotov's
Somebody told me them pirates had got lost
Cause we've been off slave ships
Got our own pyramids, write our own hieroglyphs
Just call this shit hiiipower
Nigga nothing less than hiiipower
5 star dishes, food for thought bitches
I mean this shit is Fred Hampton on your campus
You can't resist his HiiiPower
Throw your hands up for HiiiPower
Thug life, thug life!
Where are we going? Why are we slowing down?
Where are you going? We should be growing now
(Smoke to it nigga, smoke to it nigga)
Where are we going? We should be slowing down
Where are you going? We should be growing now
That’s what she said to me, the place I used to call home is just a bed to me
We don’t even sleep, neighbors can hear her weep
Meanwhile I’m in these streets with everybody, I’m trying to get it
And she know they got me, I watch her feelings watch me
As they stare me with the saddest eyes of loneliness
Look each other in the face and barely blink
Tried to make it right but the pen ran out of ink
So if my letters don’t reach you, I hope these lyrics in sync
Where are we going? Why are we slowing down?
Where are you going? We should be growing now
That’s what it said to me but the place I call ambition now dead to me
Gone and forgotten, I’m off track like Dale Earnhardt, my liver rotten
Alcoholic tripping, fucking bad bitches and they got bad intentions
Club night, guys and dolls, balling out but I’m about to drop the ball
I’m calling out for help, my engineer called
Told me come to the studio but I wanna tell nah
That’s what he said to but that place we call Heaven is unfair to me
Only 144 can go, seven billion people on planet Earth today
Is there something that I don’t know?
I know to follow him rather than follow people or follow vanity
‘Cause that means I’m following evil, guess I’m following evil
I should follow cathedral, blessings I need but live like I don’t need you
So in conclusion, we all seem to stumble, planning our own demise
Forgetting the big picture and making it wallet size
So to what is important in my life, I apologize
I promise to stay faithful, focused and sanctified, we all get distracted
The question is would you bounce back or bounce backwards?
Would you not know how to act or take action? It’s just a part of life
And if your vision’s impaired, you probably lose it all tonight
Trying to visualize how to get it right but my vision’s so blurry
Trying to slow it down, stay close to the ground but we’re always in a hurry
And if I could make this world stand a little slower then I would
Then we could grow a little closer, I think we’re getting closer
I think we’re getting closer…
Lord forgive me
Kill him where he stand or stand over him shake his hand
Then jump back in that mini van, double back to his block
Then blam I ain't backing down for nothing
I'm a back 'em down like Shaq with this black 2-2-3 in my hand
Better pray that this chopper jam, like a radio single, man
Police radio signals sayin' that a 187 land on your corner,
ners comfort your mama, mama he's dead,
The next morning high toasted up with my homies
We drink and smoke marijuana, want us to change our ways? Uh-huh
You see this game we play come from uncles that raised me in Compton
Ask me what I have accomplished
I don't know I don't have conscience
I just load up and start dumpin' on enemies I'm head hunting
No sympathy, ain't no love when you in these streets just get something
Protect ya neck cause they comin' for set respects split your onion
Then chop your deck your head tumblin' like gymnastics
Cause ignorance is bliss
Now everybody put your hands up high
If you don't give a fuck put your hands up high
This the hardest shit you've heard from LA this far
And I'm this far, from a discharge but never will I dish off
We all tryna ball and when I got the rock I'll dish off
Until the day I pistol whip you posers till ya'll pissed off
Then peel off, in a hooptie
Come back and make these niggas wanna shoot me
And they bitches wanna salute me or seduce me
Indubitably I'm too street
Indubitably I'm a do me
Better than your bitch would
But you niggas too weak, but just give me 2 weeks
And I'm good
I'll make an album that'll put a smile on Malcolm
Make Martin Luther tell God I'm the future for Heaven's talent
No tarot card reading I'm foreseeing you niggas vanish
Not only from the rap game, I'm including the planet
Cats so watered down clowns can sink Titanic
Tie titanium around their neck and watch em panic
Give me respect, dammit, or get damaged
Die young, corpse identified by your parents
Apparently you a parrot
Mocking me and my blueprint
But I won't share it just make you cop it then call you a sheriff
Stop it, I'm hearin' the comments
The critics are calling me conscious
But truthfully, every shooter be callin' me Compton
So truthfully, only calling me Kweli and Common?
Proves, that ignorance is bliss
Now everybody put your hands up high
If you don't give a fuck put your hands up high
And this still the hardest shit you've heard from LA this far
And I'm this far, from a discharge but never will I dish off
This my world, I grab the universe then play kickball
And they wonder why these California earthquakes hit so hard
I'm so-Cal, you so called
Rappers need to go call
Ghostbusters to shoot busters I'm Casper when I go off
I show up, to show out to show off
You a hundred percent behind me
And if you hard then wreck your car and walk up to my crime scene
I remember being 17 wishing someone would sign me
Now the only way these labels get me back is when they rewind me
Backin' down boggins
Backin' down bitches
We gon' flip her once she off that blue dolphin
You gon' tip her
Cause ignorance is bliss
And Willy B I'm a fool on yo beats, I bleed out the speaker
As the speaker that spoke when they done speak

Go go go
Let's go
Let's go...
Your something diffrent
I'm glad I found you!
Your so pretty
Id never do anything to hurt you
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us, love people
I'm inspired, so get inspired
And so he said "Why you gotta be so kind hearted?
Why you couldn't be a con artist? Why you couldn't?
Why you couldn't be mischievous or just a lil devious
The moment that we first started?
Why you never ask for nothing, just a lil time?
Why you let me use yours cus I don't got mine?
Why you always lift me up, when I'm completely giving up
Or when niggas holla, "What's up?" you give a dry response?
Why you giving me your last knowing you ain't got it?
Why you always buy me something when you going shopping?
Why you tell me that you love me, Why you always thinking of me
Want my company rather than going club hopping?
Why you treating my momma like she your momma too?
Why you making promises that you'll forever do?
Whatever just to make me happy, wanting us to have a family
These are exactly the reasons why I cheat on you" (Sometimes)
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
Sometimes I, sometimes I feel we share
Nothing in common, it ain't fair
But where do we seem to fall
Where do we seem to fall
Tender love and care, once upon a time
Once upon a time, we was there
And so she said "Why you gotta be so mean to me?
Why you don't know what you mean to me?
Why you always playing games? Why I feel like you ashamed
Out in public curse me out and make a scenery?
Why you got other bitches rolling their eyes at me?
Why text messages popping up saying, "Hi, Daddy"?
Why you treat me like I'm nothing? Why you always at a function?
I be wanting to go out but you don't ever ask me
Why you slip and say her name when we having sex?
Why you always assuming that I still love my ex?
Everytime we get into it, I'm the one that's feeling stupid
You don't need me, you gon' leave me, that's ya favorite threat
Why you never know how it feel to be lonely?
Why I feel I'm the last option after ya homies?
Why you always gotta know that I will never let you go
Even tho you get violent and put your hands on me?" (Sometimes)
She says she loves me
She says she loves me
So she clings to me, even when I want to be left alone
But she's beautiful
Like sometimes when I have things on my mind, shes the perfect person to listen
And she only gives advice
She says she loves me
And she only gives advice
She says she loves me
Like when I wake up in the morning, shes sitting on the edge of the bed with a plate of food, wanting to feed me
She says she needs me
She says she loves me
Or like when I'm stepping out of the shower, she's standing there with the towel, wanting to, wanting to dry me off
She says, she says she loves me
So instead of admitting that she has made another mistake
She says she loves me... and I don't know about love
[I used to want to be like Michael Jordan. Figure out what hit the NBA. And make me a fortune]
Uhh Every time I'm in my city I be hacking like my shit.don't stink.
Used to clean my rolling chain with alcohol in the sink.
Ridin' 'round with niggas that I grew up with since Mac-nair.
Bumpin' me against the world,Hello world, Kendrick here!
And I'm too much for these niggas.
I'm three much for these ho's.
I'm too much for these niggas
I'm three much for these ho's.
I'm too much for these niggas
I'm three much for these ho's.
Wayne told me that,
and that's just how it goes.
Michael Jordan
Bounce bounce, ho. Bounce Bounce!
This shit make a nigga get some bread or bust a head or fuck my enemy's bitch, actin' bad and gettin' rich.
Pull up on these 26's
I'm a vanity slave.
I'm a sinner, Jesus Christ.
Please forgive me for my ways.
I don't know why your bitch want to fuck me.
And I don't know why you fuck-niggas can't see.
I'm a Comp-town representer.
Concrete back-flipper.
AKA that nigga'..don't worrwy.
I don't know why your bitch want to fuck me.
And I don't know why you fuck-niggas can't see.
This is Hiii-power
Since the Eddie Bower,

I don't know why your bitch want to fuck me.
I don't know why (hey, wait a minute motherfucker)
[Chorus]
Everytime I'm in my city I be feelin' like my shit don't stink.
Used to clean my rolling chain with alcohol in the sink.
Ridin' 'round with niggas that I grew up with since Mac-nair.
Bumpin' me against the world,Hello world, Kendrick here!
And I'm too much for these niggas.
I'm three much for these ho's.
I'm too much for these niggas
I'm three much for these ho's.
I'm too much for these niggas
I'm three much for these ho's.
Wayne told me that,
and that's just how it goes.
Michael Jordan, bitch. (4x).
That means I'm too much for these niggas.
I'm three much for these ho's.
Wayne told me that,
and that's just how it goes.
Man, the game chose me, what am I to do?
The only thing I did wrong was make it possible.
I diddy-bop and make them titties pop.
Out there on my bumper, like a city-cop.
Walkin' out the fresh seagull ?? Put my girl on it.
Ass so fat, probably sit the world on it.
Ayy..
Pussy crazy
Pussy crazy.
YOU FUCK NIGGAS.
Your pussy's crazy!
Man, I know I can't tell you about the world, homie.
But I know I can tell you about your girl, homie.
Her pussy's crazy.
Her pussy crazy.
I FUCK NIGGA.
I know you hate me.
I know they pay me too much of attention.
Bring my name up, it gotta be mentioned.
I need me an engine
that can go real fast.
Call it hall of fame
once it hall ass.
Give me tall glass
Coke is a rock??
Please, no soda pop.
I make my soda pop.
Life's a bitch.
Her pussy crazy,
but I make that pussy pay me.
[Chorus]
Everytime I'm in my city I be feelin' like my shit don't stink.
Used to clean my rolling chain with alcohol in the sink.
Ridin' 'round with niggas that I grew up with since Mac-nair.
Bumpin' me against the world,Hello world, Kendrick here!
And I'm too much for these niggas.
I'm three much for these ho?s.
I'm too much for these niggas
I'm three much for these ho's.
I'm too much for these niggas
I'm three much for these ho's.
Wayne told me that,
and that's just how it goes.
Michael Jordan, bitch. (4x).
That means I'm too much for these niggas.
I'm three much for these ho's.
Wayne told me that.
[Schoolboy Q]
I remember trippin' walkin' through the sack like my glock don't think.
Grandma in the kitchen, that bone's in the sink.
I don't know why you bitch want to fuck me.
And I don't know why you sucka-niggas can't see.
I-I-I'm from hoover man.
High as super man.
Shit you Louis Lane.
You pussy man,
with the pussy game.
Shit, we off the chain.
We poppin' the fortune not the fame.
Shit, you backers, man.
You chasin' ho's.
Re-replacing ho's.
Bag-and-pass them ho's.
You brought and chose.
Guess she movin' on.
Yep, we do it wrong.
We fuck the homes.
Fuck the center-homes.
Marijuana strong.
You know I'm gone.
Turn my swagger on.
Am I swagged enough?
My paper long.
Yep, you left alone.
Y-Y-Y-You gets no fucks.
Leanin' off the act of us.
Passin' blunts round-and-round.
Told me Mary was a go,
so we passed her round and round.
Your bitch texted me, wants it now,
so I had to knock her down.
Hurt her bouncin' off my balls.
Slingin dick up from the mouth??
You let it slide, I hit home-runs.
Clean her dugout 'til I'm done.
I can be your number 2 and you can be her number 1.
Her pussy's crazy.
Her pussy's crazy.
YOU FUCK-NIGGAS.
[Chorus, Kendrick Lamar]
Everytime I'm in my city I be feelin' like my shit don't stink.
Used to clean my rolling chain with alcohol in the sink.
Ridin' 'round with niggas that I grew up with since Mac-nair.
Bumpin' me against the world, Hello world, Kendrick here!
And I'm too much for these niggas.
I'm three much for these ho?s.
I'm too much for these niggas
I'm three much for these ho's.
I'm too much for these niggas
I'm three much for these ho's.
Wayne told me that,
and that's just how it goes.
Michael Jordan, bitch. (4x).
That means I'm too much for these niggas.
I'm three much for these ho's.
Wayne told me that,
and that's just how it goes.
This is me thinking at 4:43 AM, June 6
Sometimes I wanna say fuck rapping, I need money now
Like should I start trapping? If what I write down
Don't collect this very moment then I'm on it, no question
In the streets my niggas is well connected, let's see
Do I cop a pound of kush, Promethazine or push some E?
Oxycontin have me laying on soft cotton when I sleep?
This is deep as the abyss, I'm not just rhyming on the beat
I be in spots chopping the rocks like flintstone feet
This is me frustrated, battling my own evils
Finna saddle up that work, across Ohio in a Geo
Or should I sell my music .zip to buy your zip
And hope one day it flourish to a kilo, track record of a hustler
Rather records on the needle, making music
Clocking fast bank like a shot from Patrick Ewing
My nigga, what you doing on these corners with me?
"I thought you had a show?" Well ma nigga I guess I didn't
I'm tryna get this dough and easy money sounds tempting
Especially when your homies pushing V8 engines
Twenty-two on twenty-sixes, Range Rovers rolling up
Three-fifty for an ounce of fire, I hope I got enough
This industry calling my bluff, I need a new solution
Curve-serving, know I might be in your store boosting
Two-elevens with MAC-11s like fuck Hip Hop
Don't wanna be Pun, don't wanna be B.I.G., don't wanna be 'Pac
Just give me your funds, A.K.A. everything that you got
Or everything getting shot, for nothing
Leave you in shock, coughing up blood and mumbling
Watch, the plans of a young man sponsor
Moving grams like relocating your mom's momma
Then expand to the Hoover dam, water
Sherm, contraband, they yearn for the butt-naked
Fuck a verse, verses get let off in thirty minutes, six seconds
I disperse to the world of unruly, where I put the mic down
And pick up a sack and a toolie, if you knew me
You'll know I always had a passion for riddle when writing
But lately I've been thinking bout taking chances to brighten
My future financially, so please don't be mad at me
I gotta do what I gotta do, no shit
So I tell my nigga front me, let me put it on the strip
Then give it back when I think about the consequence, shit
There are times, when you need someone
I will be by your side
Oh darling, cause there is a light that shines
Special for you, and me yeah
I-take-I-take-take my chances-chances-chances
Before they pass, they pass, they pass
Pass me by, oh darling
You've got to look at the other side
R.O.T.C
Right on time conscience
One time
Reporting live
Compton, California
Verse 1:
Have you ever felt like, like you never get life?
Like you never get right? Sort of like a black sheep
Back down, backing ultra dreams like some bad sleep
Chasing for the wind but you never win the track meet
Oh what a cold world for a broke nigga--it's bitter
And life's a bitch, don't hit women so I bit her
I struck enough pain let her know I wasn't playin'
I was so sincere like Nas first name
And back, they tell me
It's very difficult to see 25 and if I survive I'd probably wouldn't sell it
My opportunities are low because my brown complexion floats in the ghetto rather in some heels like Giuseppe's
They want me unemployed, until I hit the streets for fillin' voids of broke D-Boys sellin' weed
Fuckin' up my prestige, till I live with the blues
BB King or the neighbors of Snoop
Chorus:
That's why I'm in the club like fuck it, though
They say it's only one life, life, life
And if you say I can't live comfortable
Ima tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
So while I hold this bottle of Ciroc with a hand full of ass
Celebrate the very day that I get past
Moving barbed wire
We are, we are (fight!)
We are, we are (truth!)
through barbed, through barbed, (wire!)
we will, we will break (through!)
So while I hold this bottle of Ciroc with a hand full of ass
Celebrate the very day that I get past
Moving barbed wire
Verse 2:
Have you ever felt like, like you never get life
Like you never did right? Sort of like a black sheep
Tryna get away from the World stereotype
Barbed wire got a barricade on your destiny
She desperately in need of some inspiration, see what the people sayin'
She gon have a baby then flee from her education
At the age of 16, credit card scam schemes
See a scar on her eye, boyfriend brutality
She will never get by, no how no way
Where every recipientt, property of the state
Housing, Section 8, corner store, prostitute
The owner bout to prosecute, the niggas tell her that she's cute
Hood rat trash, 6 baby-da
This and this baby-ca
it's due to the family,
Chillin' in pajamis
Waitin' on the first
Fast forward spillin' drinks on her fur
Chorus:
That's why she in the club like fuck it, though
They say it's only one life, life, life
And if you say she can't live comfortable
She gon tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
So while she up in VIP pourin' Merlot in the glass
Celebrate the very day that she get past
Moving barbed wire
We are, we are (fight!)
We are, we are (truth!)
Through the, through barbed (wire!)
We will, we'll break (through!)
So while she in the VIP pourin' Merlot in the glass
Celebrate the very day that she get past
Moving barbed wire
Verse 3:
Have you ever felt like, you finally got life
You finally got right? No longer a black sheep
Livin' off ya dreams like Christina uh-Milian in the front seat
Of a convertible eloping' to get married
What a feeling of overcoming the odds
It's like I just hit the lottery, my God
There must be a God
Cuz golly, you done made it through the fight while squabbling, I lead
Now ya lifestyles lookin' up and you escaped the crooked cops and you ain't have to kill a nigga just to make a couple bucks
And she ain't have to go and fuck on anybody for a dollar, making good decisions
Got an independent business mind
And both of ya'll are steady grindin, doin' it the legal way just tryna make a decent pay on every second of the day
But they won't give you the credit, disses out they mouth
You must enter the Illuminati just to ball out
Chorus:
In the club like fuck it, though
They say it's only one life, life, life
And if you say they can't live comfortable
They gon tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
So even though you overcame doubt and ya livin' ain't bad
Know there's a barbed wire that's always in your past
Moving barbed wire
and everybody say
cause i won't get caught again 
and i'm here to stop the trends, you can catch me if you try 
disappear into the night and I'm gone
Girl: "So you made it past all the barbed wires?"
Kendrick: "There's just one left." *Gun shot*
The hardest thing for me to do
Is to get you, to know me, within sixteen bars
That's the hardest thing
Who is K. Dot? A young nigga from Compton
On the curb writing raps next to a gun shot
On the corners where the gangsters and the killers dwell
The fraudulent tender scars that get unveiled
Everyone I knew was either crip or piru
Cousins in elementary, relatives in high school
With that being said, each one of their rivals
Was aiming something at my head, I needed survival
Got jumped, got jacked, shot at, shot back
And I don't even push a line, I'm just tryna push these rhymes
In the midst of staying neutral and discrete
My momma said you're judged by the company you keep
But what you can consider, that if it goes down
They'll kill you if you kill me, it gets deep nigga
So if you ask what I'm doing
I'm tryna duck the influence of my city that's blue-and..., real talk, and
This is why they fuck with me (real talk nigga, believe it)
This is why they fuck with me (do what I do, y'know?)
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (know that)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know
I was walking from Centennial
When an unidentified vehicle rolled up, and I was like hol' up
Where you from? "How-bang"
Where you stay? "Westside", that's a piru gang to be exact
Well aware they had blue across they hat
Dropped backpack and ran inside of the cul-de-sac
Shots rang out, hoping to God I wasn't wet
Crossed to cross Rosecrans and ran inside of the yet
Chirped the homies on the hot ninety-five, they said they already knew
What happened, and meet 'em outside the garage
Never seen that many guns in my life
I was paranoid like a fiend in the night, but needed revenge
Grabbed the nine-ball, opened up the door, then got in
Somebody said fall back,
we gon' make these niggas suffer
You my brother like a frat, and that's just to remind you
Thought about that so long I had failed my finals
This is why they fuck with me (I told you nigga)
This is why they fuck with me (you fake nigga)
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (you fake)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know
I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I do everyday life music
Give 'em cuts like a nigga pierced a knife through it
You say you through, but I've been through it, now that's cold
And this is for my county building children
In Hub City on hubcaps, no power-steering
I use perseverance in this mad city
Where the niggas drink Remy and hold semis for cutthroats
Bernie Mac died, it's no joke
Don't ask why if you don't know about these killers and thieves
Seven grams of weed, you smoke that, but I'm high off life
I could fall out the sky like twice
And land in the land of the AKs
And the minivans where the fan never on
Cause it's hotter than a lunatic's underarms in a straitjacket
In other words, we get it cracking, but I keep it cool
This is why they fuck with me [laughs]
This is why they fuck with me (real talk)
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (come on)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know
But I'mma leave you with this
An old Jew once told me
A real gangster is either dead or in jail
Or behind the scenes getting real money
(H.O.C.
H.O.C.
All the real smokers gettin H.O.C.
All the real smokers gettin H.O.C.
H.O.C.
Everybody know I spit that other shit
Shit that make u duck for cover shit
Shit make hop out ur seat n slap ur mother shit
Specially when drop drop the beat
I drop jewels like my nut dropped out my briefs
Jump in the booth then shot a heavy rappers dream
They jump in a sona cus I killed they're self steam
That's a jab u should bob n weave
Like Pam like Martin pulls jokes out his sleeve
I go in studio sessions n feel like a nerd
Cus I'm the only nigga there not smokin no herb
Ur telling me the kush make u think on level four
I'm on five ur saying I could level more
In high school my teachers taught I was smoking stress
Didn't know my eyes low cus of genitic defects
I stimulate my mind
Every time I think about the end of time
Creation of men n Calibine
Look now a days everybody think they big chiffers
Just cus they herad that new tape from Wiz Kahlifia
Knowing damn well they can't hit sour
They new bootys they probably need baby powder
My skill shower over ur city for 40 days
40 nights off the chain
Like freedom of slaves
Before u get it twisted like 40 gays
My flow Worth the earth
That's not to be apraise
Thos the type of lines that I'm talkin about
U know the type of rhythms u don't talk about Copy my session on disk when the session ends
So my momma could have it n play it to her friends
Brag on me
Like my son about to win
Some how some day n I don't care when
I might hit the gin one a month
I'll let u in hell like an atheist
Ugh I'll take u back to the ninth grade
When dough boy had me high for Four days
That's my nigga
He a street nigga
Probbaly in yo hood fuckin up yo street nigga.
But anyways I think it was some purple
Told me don't hit it hard becouse it'll hurt u
I Didn't listen i was floting like the Rose Parade
Swear to god a nigga seen some flying fishes
That was the vegas trip
Who the sponsor
The same time I started writing like a fucken monster
A Frankistine everytime this motherfucker ponder
Just underline every letter capital K.D.O.T.
Laying it flat out
Like a tire wit slow leaks Now what u about
Nothing huh
Em I a square cus I don't puff a square
R my raps to blunt to hit the blunt yea
Ali you thirsty on Twitter!
You boo boooo, you T'd, you turnt down, you thirstyyy, you boo boooo! unh,
[Verse 1:]
I'm tryna learn somethin new.
I'm tryna find myself, I'm searchin deep for Kendrick Lamar,
I read about Napoleon Hill and try to know God,
They say he the key to my blessings...
And if I speak the good into existance, that instant my dreams will unlock,
Money flow like water, I'll just wait at the dock.
And by the way I'm a start,
Findin more light to shed,
Like a small garage in yo backyard.
I'm back chillin with a friend of mine.
She mighty fine but I notice that her heart resides next to bitterness.
Always hollerin who she don't like, and who she kick it with,
Who she wanna fight, who wearin a weave, who Dooney&Bourke bag is fake, who holdin the keys to the car she drove last year,
Or who fuckin on who, and who need a pap smear.
Gettin on my nerves, but before yo negative energy curve, bitch I'm a cut you off.
[Chorus:]
Cause everytime you come around,
You be hollerin that whoop de whoooop, blah ze blaaaah, he say/she say, oh my God
Shut the fuck up!
... hoe.
Everytime you come around,
You be hollerin that whoop de whooop, blah ze blaaaah, he say/she say...
[Verse 2:]
Unh,
I'm tryna learn somethin new.
I'm tryna surround myself with people that inspire me.
Or at least inquire similar desires
To do what it T-A-K-E just to reach the T-O-P.
I'm talkin ideas, motivation
It's more than making, enemies, my nigga.
Oh that's not your memo?
Then tell me why you constantly stressin on how you well connected like centipedes, my nigga [?]
I function with you and you flaunt your pistol
Every second tell me how you pressed em at the Monte Crystal.
Where so&so from, and what neighborhoods beefin,
Who baby momma's a rat, and who got killed last weekend.
That shit is mad depressin, bringin me down.
Speak on somethin with some substance that can get us both paid rather than tellin me how these niggas jockin yo style,
Or his rims ain't bigga.
Pussy nigga,
I'm a cut you off.
[Chorus:]
Cause everytime you come around,
You be hollerin that whoop de whoooop, blah ze blaaaah, he say/she say, oh my God
Shut the fuck up!
... scary ass!
Everytime you come around,
You be hollerin that whoop de whoooop, blah ze blaaah, he say/she say...
[Verse 3:]
I'm tryna learn somethin new.
I'm tryna better my chances of becoming a star.
I'm tryna feel the vibe of Mona Lisa, studying art.
Now paint that picture.
Life behind bars, remember the very day I got caught?
I murdered a rapper, and you filed the police report?
See what I was taught,
Family is all I need but indeed them too can run me right up a tree.
Constantly talkin shit 'bout the next relative,
Wanting me to take sides, but I'd never give in.
Ever since grandma died, everyone parted ways.
Argue on holidays,
Left my uncle in prison for 15 years no one paid,
Him attention but moms, yeah my momma as loyal as any sister would come.
Come to my house just to yap bout your own people... dang,
And if yo blood wasn't runnin through my veins I would prolly cut ya'll off... too! yep.
[Chorus:]
Cause everytime ya'll come around,
Ya'll be hollerin that whoop de whoooop, blah ze blaaah, he say/she say, oh my God
Shut the fuck up!
(Keep it runnin Ali)
Everytime you come around,
You be hollerin that whoop de whooop, blah ze blaaah, he say/she say...
[Breakdown:]
So tell em, "shut the fuck up! "
Tell em, "shut the fuck up! "
Yeah bitch you boo boooo, you T'd, you turnt dowwwnnn, you thirstyyy.
Tell em, "shut the fuck up."
Tell em, "shut the fuck up! "
Yeah nigga you boo booo, you T'd, you turnt dowwwnnn, you thirstyyyy.
You thirstyyyyy, you boo booo, you T'd, you turnt dowwwnnn,
You boo booo, you T'd, you boo boooo, you turnt dowwwnnn,
You thirstyyy, you T'd, you boo boooo, you turnt downnn...
You boo boooo, you T'd, you turnt downnn,
You weeeaaakk, you weeaakkk, yo bitch weeeaakkk, yo... hahahaha. you boo boooo, you T'd.
Keep all that.
[Intro]
I miss you, where you been?
It's been months and I haven't heard from you, I need you
It's been months and I haven't heard from you, come back to me
Come back, I need you in my life
I miss you, I miss you, come back to me, I miss you
[Dom Kennedy]
What's up baby? It's been a while
You been good? I've been around
different girls, different towns
To keep it real, you missing out
I'll all bored, next city
Random cars, TEC's with me
Like I miss you so much, have sex with me
Not right now, look you know I got the ex with me
She like fuck that, I don't care Dom
So selfish and that really isn't fair Dom
Meet me here, where Dom?
Get undressed, yeah Dom
Yeah Dom, what you need?
Some bomb head? A bag of weed?
Good food? Japanese?
That's me on page forty in that magazine
"Dom Kennedy" you need that
She said nobody come close, I agreed back
I'm the nigga who used to help her pull that weed back
and she need me, believe that
[Chorus: Javonte]
That girl is smoking
and can you believe that I'm her focus?
It ain't hard to see she got me open
and together, we are roller-coasting, on, on, on
[Kendrick Lamar]
What's up love? It's been a while
You been good? I've been around
Remember dinner dates I was late? Mr. Chiles
Truant like a student, you the principal
Schooled me on timing, we was both shining
like the sun bouncing off the brightest blood diamond
I was Your Highness, you was my queen
You got over him when I got in between
Watching Martin on TV as it was T-D-S
for us to eat TV dinners every time we was famished
But it was such a pleasure to watch you try to hold it together
Every time I put the head in you would panic
and come right down like an avalanche
Make your legs slant, whisper till you juicing up your pants
Baby how that sound? Kosher, no sir
Wake it back up, Folgers posters
By my waistline, shout for your hard hit
You called it a hate crime, say you want me back
and your girl wanna date Dom, that's high school shit
4-0-1 K, we could be friends with benefits, you dig that?
[Chorus]
[MURS]
I upped and walked out, now she crying cuz
She need me, I got that John Bryan love
Had to find love, we called it punch-drunk
We was a two-piece, she was a one-punch
You know, a knock-out, and if she was to walk out
my heart would go black, shrivel up and drop out
There we go again, what the fuck you talking bout?
We used to fuck all the time back at my momma's house
Smoking beedies, laying on the futon
Memories I got saved up like a coupon
And we'd be too gone off a sack of stress weed
I was broke then, couldn't count the best weed
Then she would just leave in a black hatchback
Homies from the hood used to ask me if I'd tapped that
I would say yep, smiling so freely
That was back then, but I bet she still need me
She need me, she need me
She need me, she need me
I would say yes, smiling so freely
That was back then, I bet she still need me
[Chorus]
